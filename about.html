<h3>System Advisor Model (SAM)</h3>
<p>System Advisor Model (SAM) modules are used to perform energy calculations. The program uses the SAM SDK API (SSC Version: 206; Feb 9 2019; System Advisor Model Version 2018.11.11 Revision 2 (SAM 2018.11.11) or later versions. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Golden, CO. <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/content/downloads">https://sam.nrel.gov/content/downloads</a>.)</p>
<p>The System Advisor Model (&ldquo;Model&rdquo;) is provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (&ldquo;NREL&rdquo;), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (&ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;) for the U.S. Department Of Energy (&ldquo;DOE&rdquo;) and may be used for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>SAM uses meteorological and solar data to model output of various renewable energy technologies. MERRA-2 data is a suitable source to generate data files for input to SAM.</p>
<p>In creating the weather files use is made of two NREL models - the DISC DNI Model (<a href="http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/models/DISC/">http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/models/DISC/</a>) and the DNI-GHI to DHI Calculator (<a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/sites/sam.nrel.gov/files/content/documents/xls/DNI-GHI_to_DHI_Calculator.xlsx">https://sam.nrel.gov/sites/sam.nrel.gov/files/content/documents/xls/DNI-GHI_to_DHI_Calculator.xlsx</a>).
<h3>ERA5 data</h3>
<p>ERA5 is a dataset provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is available from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). ERA5 is a comprehensive reanalysis, from 1940 to 5 days behind real time, which assimilates as many observations as possible in the upper air and near surface<. The data used by SIREN is <em>ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present</em>. It provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.</p>
<h3>MERRA-2 data</h3>
<p>The Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) is a NASA atmospheric data reanalysis for the satellite era using a major new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System Version 5 (GEOS-5). MERRA-2 focuses on historical analyses of the hydrological cycle on a broad range of weather and climate time scales, and places the NASA EOS suite of observations in a climate context. This data is made available through the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and the GES DISC.</p>
<h4>wget</h4>
<p>The getmerra2 tool uses <code>wget.exe</code> to download MERRA-2 files. <code>wget.exe</code> is distributed under the GNU General Public License. For details see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/</a></p>
<h3>SWIS Load and Other Data</h3>
<p>SIREN uses current load data to model system performance against actual load. The data is obtained from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO; formerly from the Independent Market Operator, IMO).
The AEMO collects and collates a range of data relating to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) within the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) in Western Australia.</p>
<h3>Default Map</h3>
<p>The default map has been derived from <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/" target="_blank">MapQuest</a> Open Aerial Tiles. This base map data &copy; OpenStreetMap contributors CC-BY-SA <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright"> http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</a>.</p>
<h3>Open source community</h3>
<p>Software approaches, techniques and ideas used in developing SIREN have been greatly facilitated by the strong open community of Python developers who are willing to share their knowledge and by the power of the Internet in making this information available.
