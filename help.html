<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to SEN's renewable energy conceptual simulation - SIREN.</p>
<p>The worlds renewable energy resources could provide many times the amount of fossil-fuelled energy currently used. SEN's computer simulation models an electricity network and allows you to create, cost and evaluate scenarios for supplying electricity using a mixture of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>By placing virtual renewable energy plants around the area of interest, you will be able to determine the optimal locations to access renewable energy sources, minimise grid connection costs and meet the varying demand on the grid, while achieving the best in terms of efficiency, cost effectiveness and energy security.</p>
<p>This version of the Simulation uses the SAM SDK API for energy calculations. SAM is provided by the NREL.</p>
<h3>Southern Western Australia (WA)</h3>
<p>WA's renewable energy resources could provide many times the amount of fossil-fuelled energy currently used in the state. SEN's computer simulation models the SWIS and allows you to create, cost and evaluate scenarios for supplying our electricity using a mixture of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>By placing virtual renewable energy plants around WA, you will be able to determine the optimal locations to access renewable energy sources, minimise grid connection costs and meet the varying demand on the SWIS, while achieving the best efficiency, cost effectiveness, energy security, job creation and carbon reduction for Southern WA.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The default data provided with the simulation focuses on the SWIS but the program(s) have been constructed to cover any geographic area with the appropriate input files. The techniques to create the required data files is documented in <a href="#notes">Supporting Notes</a>.</p>
<h3>About SEN</h3>
Sustainable Energy NOW, SEN (<a href="http://sen.asn.au" target="_blank">sen.asn.au</a>), is a not-for-profit association incorporated in Western Australia (WA) with a focus on renewable energy.
<p><strong>Our Definition of Sustainable Energy</strong>: &ldquo;Energy that is renewable within a human lifetime and can be produced safely and equitably for all time with minimal impact on the environment and future inhabitants&rdquo;. We believe this does not include nuclear power with its many unresolved issues.</p>
<p><strong>Our Focus</strong>: To raise awareness of how a mix of renewable energy technologies are able to meet WA's energy needs, with a particular focus on the main electricity grid, the SWIS.</p>
<p><strong>Our Computer Simulation (SIREN)</strong>: To demonstrate how electricity demand on the SWIS may be met by a mix of renewable energy sources. Users are able to explore potential location and scale of renewable energy sources (stations, storage, transmission) to meet electricity demand.</p>

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p>At present there is a packaged version of the simulation for Windows (don't know why only Windows because I'm a Linux fan; the package has been created with PyInstaller). To execute the simulation open <em>siren.exe</em> in the upper folder, <em>siren</em>. You can easily set up a Desktop shortcut to point to the model. The package contains a number of folders with default files that can be replaced with your own. The location of these files are defined in a Preferences file as documented in <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>. The default files are located in the following folders:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>sample_files</em> contains a range of files to enable operation of the simulation</li>
<li><em>sam-sdk</em> contains a Windows version of the SAM SDK, <em>sam-sdk-2015-06-30</em></li>
<li><em>solar_weather</em> (if present) contains solar (.smw) weather files for the SWIS for 2014 and 2015</li>
<li><em>source</em> contains the Python source programs for SIREN</li>
<li><em>wind_weather</em> (if present) contains wind (.srw) weather files for the SWIS for 2014 and 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>When you open SIREN you will be presented with a list of SIREN Models (Preferences files). Choose the SIREN Model you want by clicking on your choice. If want to use a specific Preferences file you can open the simulation passing the alternate file name as a parameter, for example:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>siren.exe SIREN_NWIS.ini</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to create a new Model press the <em>New Model</em> button on the start up menu. You will be presented with a small list of Properties to update to create a new Preferences file. Many of these properties relate to files and file locations as described in <a href="#setup">Setting Up</a>. It's important to ensure they're correct for the new model to open. For the file fields click on the field to navigate to the desired file or folder. At the bottom of the Create Preferences file menu you have options to Save the new file, Save the new file and edit it, or Save it and open (launch) the new model.
<div class="experiment">
<p><strong>Experimental features</strong></p>
<p>There are some experimental features in SIREN which may or may not be further developed. These are identified within this help by a red bounding box.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="setup">Setting Up</h2>
<p>The simulation uses external &ldquo;data files&rdquo; to model the potential for renewable energy generation for a geographic region. The approach is to model the data on an hourly basis for a desired year (ignoring leap days, that is, 8,760 hours). The following data files are required / desirable. Due to the initial source for each data file the format for each is different (see <a href="#files">SIREN File Formats</a> for further details). Please <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> any desired formats as it's relatively easy to accommodate standard file formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A map of the area of interest (identified in the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file). A simple JPEG or PNG image is fine although most conventional image formats should be acceptable. The map covers a geographically rectangular area of the earth. Obtaining a suitable map image is described in <a href="#map">Obtaining a Suitable Map Image</a></li>
<li>Names and locations of towns. Two files are used as input (either or both can be specified):
<ol>
<li>An Excel file containing a list of weather stations from the BOM (identified by <em>bom</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</li>
<li>A CSV file containing the location of additional towns or localities (identified by <em>towns</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Names, technologies and locations of existing power stations (identified by <em>grid_stations</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This is either a CSV or Excel file which contains details of existing Facilities (Stations) registered with the local electricity regulator (AEMO in the case of the SWIS) augmented by geographic location of the station and details on turbines for wind farms. The CSV file may be either a specific format or a normal scenario file. You can update this file for the SWIS as described in <a href="#swisupd">Obtaining Current SWIS Facilities</a>.
<br>
You can also create additional stations, such as Rooftop PV, to be included in the list of existing stations by creating an additional Stations file and setting the <em>grid_stations2</em> property in the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>A layout of the existing electrical grid. A KML file showing the layout of the major power lines in the grid and an outline of the network (SWIS) boundary. This should be a simplified version of the grid network with all lines connecting exactly for SIREN to correctly connect new stations into the grid
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The intention of these two files is to describe the existing fossil and renewable Stations on the electricity network</li>
<li>Hourly load details for the electricity grid. A simple CSV file with a single column of electrical load data for the 8,760 hours in the year of interest (identified by <em>load</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</li>
<li>Hourly solar and weather details for the area of interest (identified by <em>solar_files</em> and <em>wind_files</em> properties of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This data is in formats required for input to SAM and contains entries for the 8,760 hours in the year of interest. A SAM weather file is a text file that contains one year's worth of data describing the solar resource, wind speed, temperature, and other weather characteristics at a particular location. The approach we have adopted is to use NASA MERRA-2 data for the desired geographic area and year to create appropriately formatted weather files. This is described in <a href="#merra">Obtaining and Using NASA MERRA-2 Data for SAM</a>.
<br>
You can also use TMY files such as those provided with SAM. If you have a number of weather files you can create an index of these files for SIREN. This is described in <a href="#index">Using other Weather Files</a></li>
<li>SIREN allows you to visualise renewable resource attributes. This utilises a summary file to avoid having to process all the weather files covered by the map (identified by <em>resource_grid</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This is described in <a href="#resource">Visualising Renewable Resource Attributes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can successfully use the simulation with just the map and weather data while existing load and network data enhance it's usefulness.
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="objects">Simulation Objects</h2>
<p>The simulation has two main objects, stations and grid lines. Stations can be saved as scenarios in either an Excel or CSV file format while grid lines are constructed during the simulation rather than being saved to a file (unless you have manually created the grid line).</p>
<h3 id="stations">Stations</h3>
<p>Stations represent either existing generation stations on the grid or new ones you have created during a simulation session. The station files can be updated outside of the simulation. The fields for a station are:</p>
<table border="0", class="none">
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Station Name</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The name you assigned to the station. They must be unique within a simulation session. If you add a new scenario with a station that has the same name as one already active the program will append a number to make the name(s) unique</td>
</tr>

<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Area</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The estimated area for the station. This is (currently) calculated by the simulation so you need not enter a value. Stations will be displayed on the map with either a square or circle representing their physical footprint (the shape can be set by setting <em>station_shape</em> in the <a href="#p_grid">[Grid]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</td>

<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Power File</dfn></td>
<td class="none">If the technology you're interested in is not available in the simulation or you encounter problems you can provide your own power file which contains power output for each hour of the year. This can be produced using SAM itself. Within SAM you display output data, select the Hourly energy data and export the file as either CSV or Excel, and place the file in the same location as your scenario files. When the Power Model is run the program will use this data rather than invoking the SAM module for that station</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Storage Hours</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The number of hours of storage for Solar Thermal stations. If the value isn't set SIREN will use the <em>tshours</em> property in the <a href="#p_solar_thermal">[Solar Thermal]</a> Section of the Preferences file</td>

<td class="none"><dfn>Grid Line</dfn></td>
<td class="none">If you have edited the grid line for a station (see <a href="#mouse">Right Mouse Click</a>) this will record the coordinates for the grid line as a series of latitude, longitude values</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Direction</dfn></td>
<td class="none">For PV stations you can specify the direction in which the panels are facing as a character representation of the direction. Acceptable values are:- N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW or NNW. The default is N for southern latitude stations and S for northern latitude (that is, towards the midday sun)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When you display a Station with SIREN it will also show the Scenario the Station is in. For new Stations (i.e. not Existing) it is possible to update this value to one of the other scenarios that are currently &ldquo;open&ldquo;. This will move the Station into that scenario and, if the scenario is saved move it permanently into that Scenario.</p>
<h3 id="gridlines">Grid Lines</h3>
<p>Grid lines connect new stations to either existing or other new grid lines. By default the grid line will connect a station to the nearest point on the grid. You can edit a grid line if you wish to connect it elsewhere in the grid. Grid lines are recalculated when you add or modify stations but are not normally saved. You can, however, list the (new) grid lines and save the table listed. The fields for a grid are:</p>
<table border="0", class="none">
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Name</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The name of the station the grid line connects from</td>

</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Substation Cost</dfn></td>
<td class="none">There are a range of costs related to the infrastructure at both ends of the line. We'll use the term substation_costs to embrace all these costs. Each line that ultimately ends up reaching the load centre will have a peak load for all stations that follow that particular path to the load centre. These lines will have substation costs based upon the peak load. The costs will/may be allocated across all stations in the path</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3 id="grid">Types of Grid Lines</h3>
<p>A grid is built up of a number of different types of line to enable differing loads to be carried. Each line has a maximum carrying capacity. Greater loads require additional lines to be added; so in this simulation one line may represent multiple grid lines as described in the <em>Line Table</em> for the line. For dispatchable transmission we need an extra path for backup purposes (N-1) while no such backup is required for non-dispatchable loads (N-0). For a line carrying both we'll use a criteria of N-0 for total load plus N-1 for dispatchable load. Within this simulation line types and costs can be specified (somewhat cryptically) in the <a href="#p_grid">[Grid]</a> Section of the Preferences file. The default set of lines are:</p>

<h2 id="prefs">Preferences</h2>
<p>Many options can be specified by a Preferences file. When you open SIREN you will be presented with a list of available Preferences files (SIREN Models) to choose from. These files (must) reside in the same directory as the SIREN itself.
The format is similar to a Windows INI file. If you want to create a new Model you can press the <em>New Model</em> button on the start up menu. You will be presented with a small list of Properties to update to create a new Preferences file.
<p>The Preferences file has the following Sections and properties. The file is a simple text file which must be saved in the <em>siren</em> folder and have a file type of <em>.ini</em> (INI File). The sample <em>siren_default.ini</em> or <em>siren_windows_default.ini</em> file will provide a useful guide as to the content.</p>
<p>There are three special strings which will be replaced in the Files properties variables:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>$USER$</em>&nbsp;will be replaced with the current userid</li>

<h2 id="usage">Using the Simulation</h2>
<p>The simulation allows you to build scenarios for the energy mix for your area of interest. It is based around the map of your chosen area and allows you to visualise the layout of the existing electricity network plus the additional stations you place on the map to build your scenario(s). The map initially shows the main skeleton of the existing electricity grid infrastructure and current generation stations.</p>
<p>To add a new station simply right-click on the map at the desired location and then update the details for the station (Name, Technology, Capacity and so forth) and press <em>Save &amp; Exit</em>. You can also copy an existing station and other options as specified above. </p>
<p>As you build your scenario, the simulation adds additional infrastructure to connect the new generation plants to the grid. The colours for the majority of the items on the map are as you specify in the Preferences file. You navigate around the map using normal mouse movements to scroll, zoom, etc. and interact with it as described previously (<a href="#menus">Menus</a>). Using the various menu options you can model your whole scenario, or by right-clicking you can deal with an individual station. There are a number of additional windows, such as menu options, that can be opened to assist with using SIREN (see <a href="#windows">Windows</a>)</p>
<p>You can save multiple scenarios and add them and remove them as you wish. When you exit the simulation normally or <em>Save</em> scenarios (Ctrl+S) any modified scenarios will be saved. When you add new stations to your model they will be added as a new scenario which includes the date and time in its name, for example, Scenario_2015-06-09_1000. You can save all open scenarios as a single new scenario by using the <em>Save As...</em> option.</p>
<p>The strength of the simulation is in running the SAM Power Models (e.g. Ctrl+P). This will run the appropriate SAM model for each station you have chosen or for all renewable stations in your current simulation. SAM calculates a list of power outputs for each hour of the year (8,760 points). If the <em>show_menu</em> property is True you will be presented with a menu to specify what processing and plots to produce (see below). If you choose to run the Financial Models you will be presented with an additional menu of options.</p>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="popts">Power Model Options</h3>
<p>The Power Model options menu are as set out here. The default values are specified in the <a href="#power">[Power]</a> Section of the Preferences file. The associated property is indicated in brackets at the end of the description. If you hover over the window title bar or press F1 a help for the Options will be displayed.</p>

<p>The plots and tables are intended to assist with analysing the chosen scenario.</p>
<h4>Plots</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Energy by ...</em> options produce step plots that aggregate data into the chosen period</li>
<li><em>Power by hour</em> option produce line plots for each hour of the year</li>
<li><em>Power - diurnal ...</em> options produce line plots that summarise data to produce an average diurnal (daily) plot for each of the chosen periods</li>
<li><em>Power - Load duration</em> option produces load duration curves which show how much generation is produced for a percentage of the year</li>
<li><em>Power - Shortfall analysis</em> option produces a table and line plots that attempt to assist with analysing shortfalls on a daily basis. The analysis iterations option will produce average shortfalls for that number of days, for example, 3 iterations will produce average shortfall figures for one, two and three days. The figures are calculated by &ldquo;averaging&rdquo; the generation shortfall over the chosen number of days. This option will also produce cumulative shortfall graphs that add the average hourly shortfall to generation to attempt to flatten out the shortfall over the year</li>
</ul>
<p>The tool used to produce the plots, matplotlib, has a navigation toolbar
(<a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html" target="_blank">Interactive navigation</a>) to enable you to navigate and manipulate the plot (but doesn't allow you to change the plot data). It includes options to zoom into an area of the plot and to save the plot image (by default to the <em>scenarios</em> folder).</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> option will save generation in MWh for each chosen station for each hour of the year (8,760 hours). This can be used in detailed analysis or as an option to avoid having to reprocess the station in the future, by updating a Station's </em>Power File</em> field. The default file name can be set using the <em>data_file</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file; otherwise it will in the format of <em>Power_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm...</em></li>
<li><em>Save Powerbalance data</em> option will save save the input data for Powerbalance. Powerbalance uses the hourly shortfalls and overall generation figures in its computations. This option saves this data in a spreadsheet to simplify copying it into a Powerbalance workbook. The cells required for Powerbalance are highlighted in colour. The worksheet contains the generation summary data followed by the shortfall data</li>
<li><em>Show Summary/Other Tables</em> option will cause various tables to be presented:
<ul>
<li>A brief summary table of Capacity and Output for each selected station. The default file name will in the format of <em>powermodel_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>
<li>If Storage values are specified a storage table is produced showing hourly figures for Load, Generation, Storage Used, Storage Losses (determined by Discharge and Recharge loss percentages), Storage Balance, Shortfall and Excess. Shortfall indicates the shortfall against Load (Load less Generation, Storage Used and Losses); Excess indicates excess generation that could not be stored due to either the Storage Capacity limit or Recharge cap. The default file name will in the format of <em>Storage_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>
<li><em>Generation Summary</em> table is a brief summary of the overall generation for the current execution of the Power model. The figures are summations of the 8,760 hourly figures. Some comments on the table:
<ul>
<li>The Multiplier column indicates any multipliers from the adjust generation option (plus load if load is grown)</li>
<li>The Row column is merely a technique to display the rows in a suitable order</li>
<li>The initial rows are the totals for each of the technologies, followed by the total of all generation and the load to be met</li>
<li><em>Gen. - Load</em> is a raw indicator of generation versus load but ignoring any timing issues. A negative value indicates a shortfall in overall generation while a positive value indicates excess overall generation</li>
<li><em>Storage Capacity</em> is the amount of storage in this execution</li>
<li><em>Storage Used</em> is how much storage has been used to meet shortfall in generation for any period. This is that portion of renewable generation that has been stored and then reused</li>
<li><em>Excess Gen.</em> is energy generation that has been lost/dumped due to either full storage or constraints on storage recharge</li>
<li><em>Shortfall</em> is the lack of available energy (generation plus storage) to meet load</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>Power - Shortfall analysis</em> Plot option produces a table showing hourly figures for Load, Generation, Shortfall, and, optionally, grid losses. If iterations are chosen an additional table showing daily shortfalls for each iteration will also be produced. The default file(s) name will in the format of <em>Hourly Shortfall_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em> and <em>Daily Shortfall_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resourcegrid">Resource Grids</h3>
<p>To assist with placement of renewable energy stations SIREN can display a grid of renewable resource attributes derived from the SAM weather files. The grid can be displayed by invoking the <em>Show Resource Grid</em> (Ctrl+B) menu option. The Resource Overlay menu presented has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Weather Detail</em>. If appropriate resource files are found you'll be presented this menu option. Possible choices are:- Daily By Month (default), Hourly By Month, or Hourly By Day. With the Hourly options you'll also have additional options to navigate to a particular month and, for By Day, day</li>
<li><em>Weather Period</em>. This pulldown menu allows you to select the desired period to display. Options are for the full year, a month of the year, a season and, in the case of Hourly Weather Detail, for an hour of the day. Beside this field is a <em>Next</em> button which allows you to &ldquo;step&rdquo; through the weather periods. You can also use <em>Page Down</em> and <em>Page Up</em> to step forward and back through the weather periods.</li>
<li><em>Weather Variable</em>. This pulldown menu allows you to select the desired variable to display</li>
<li><em>Colour Steps</em>. The grid displayed can have values grouped in to up to 10 steps. A value of 0 will give a smooth graduation rather than stepped colours</li>
<li><em>Opacity</em>. Gives the degree of opacity of grid colours. A value of 1 is completely opaque while a value of 0 is completely transparent</li>
<li><em>Low Colour</em> and <em>High Colour</em>. These options present a set of buttons for each weather variable. Pressing the appropriate button will allow you to alter the upper or lower colour value for each variable. The range of colours steps will be displayed beside the buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>Altering any field will cause the revised grid to be overlaid on the SIREN map. There are four buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will close the Resource Overlay menu. Any grid will continue to be displayed</li>
<li><em>Show</em> will cause the grid to be displayed. This allows you to display the grid without changing any of the fields</li>
<li><em>Hide</em> will hide the resource grid</li>
<li><em>Save</em> will save modified fields. This updates the Preferences file for future executions of SIREN</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature utilises summary data stored in a file rather than having to process hourly data from the weather files (see <a href="#resource">Visualising Renewable Resource Attributes</a>).</p>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="tricks">Performance Tricks</h3>
<p>Processing a simulation with a large number of stations can take a while to process, especially with Solar Thermal stations. You can minimise this processing by using either of these two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you invoke Power Model processing it allows you to process Plot (and Table) options multiple times without reprocessing the stations. You can then process Financial options multiple times. The process SIREN uses is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Displays the Power Model menu allowing you to specify initial options. This allows you to choose the stations of interest and the data options you want. This first display of the menu also allows you to save these options</li>
<li>Calls the appropriate SAM module for each chosen station, or other options as specified</li>
<li>Presents the tables and plots you have selected</li>
<li>Redisplays the Power Model menu allowing you to specify different growth options, storage options and plots. A number of options, such as <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> will no longer be available as they would require reprocessing the SAM models. To process these new options press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button. To exit this phase of processing press the
<strong>All Done</strong> or <strong>Do Financials</strong> button</li>
<li>If you have chosen to run the Financial Models the Financial Model menu will be displayed, allowing you to specify initial finance options. Press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to continue with these options</li>
<li>Calls the SAM financial module for each chosen station</li>
<li>Presents the financial table</li>
<li>Redisplays the Financial Model menu allowing you to specify different options. Press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to invoke these new options. To exit this phase of processing press the <strong>All Done</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<p>
<li>If the location and size of stations haven't changed you can avoid reprocessing stations by used Power data from a previous simulation run, using the following approach.
<ol>
<li>Choose the <em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> (<em>save_data</em>) Power Model option</li>
<li>Save the data file. This file contains power output for all stations in the current simulation. It should be located in the same folder as your scenario files (<em>scenarios</em> property of <em>[Files]</em> Section). The data is saved as MWh with 4 decimal places because SAM uses kWh</li>
<li>With your spreadsheet application (Excel) update the scenarios and stations that you want to use the saved data with. Either add or use the column headed <em>Power File</em> to specify the file name you've selected for the power output. For each station enter the full name and extension of the file, for example, <em>Power_Table_Saved.xls</em></li>
<li>When you next run the simulation it will load this saved data rather than invoking the SAM module for each station that has an <em>Power File</em> entry</li>
<li>If the file is not found the SAM module will be re-invoked. So you can simply delete or rename the Power data file and re-run the simulation to get a new set of data points</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="optimise">Adjust Generation</h4>
<p>The <em>Generation - adjust generation</em> option allows you to easily adjust the contribution of each technology to the overall model by allowing you to apply a multiplier to the generation figures. The multiplier multiplies each hourly generation figure to approximate increasing the station by this size. This enables you to assess changes to the technology mix without having to alter individual stations. If you also choose the <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> option you can also do this adjustment for each station rather than each technology. This approach allows you to &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; with the generation mix without having to add or alter stations.</p>
<strong>Note:</strong> that the multiplied figures are not passed to the Financial model(s).</p>
<div class="experiment">
<p><strong>Optimise (experimental)</strong></p>
<p>SIREN also has an experimental approach to optimise the mix of technologies. If Load data is available the menu presented to adjust generation will have an option to &ldquo;optimise&rdquo; the renewable energy mix. You will be presented with an <em>Optimise for:</em> pulldown list of periods to optimise for. You choose the desired period and then press the <em>Optimise</em> button. This will then do a least squares solution for adjustment multipliers to produce a generation profile that best matches the total load and load profile for that period. The data analysis is performed on the average 24 hour figures for the chosen period. If you don't wish to include a technology (or station(s)) then uncheck the checkbox (to the right of the multiplier) for that technology. The generation produced by that technology (multiplied by it's current multiplier) will be removed from the Load and analysis undertaken on the remaining technologies and load. Any computed negative multiplier will be set to zero, which is likely to result in the computed generation exceeding the load. The analysis is based upon the stations in your scenario and doesn't take into account how well placed they are within the network.

<h2 id="files">SIREN File Formats</h2>
<p>SIREN accepts a number of file formats for each of the data files it uses. Due to the initial source for each data file the format for each is different. For Excel and CSV files the first cell for each column is usually taken as the column name. The files and formats are:</p>
<table border="0", class="none">
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>actual_power</dfn></td>
<td class="none">An Excel or CSV file containing a column of hourly generation in MWh for each (existing) station for each hour of the year (8,760 hours)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>bom</dfn></td>
<td class="none">An Excel or CSV file containing details on those BOM sites you want displayed on the map. This file format is the same as <em>towns</em> (see below) with some additional column name options</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>grid_boundary</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A KML file defining the boundary for the grid. Any string of &lt;coordinates&gt; in a &lt;LinearRing&gt; is used to draw the grid boundary or boundaries. Colour for the grid boundary can be set by either the <em>grid_boundary</em> Colour option or by a &lt;styleUrl&gt; colour element in the KML file</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>grid_network</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A KML file defining the grid network. Any string of &lt;coordinates&gt; in a &lt;LineString&gt; is used to draw a grid line. The &lt;name&gt; will be used as the Line name. This file defines the grid network SIREN uses to add in additional stations and trace their paths to load centres. As such, this should be a very simplified grid and relies on all lines connecting to one another in a true grid network. Making this grid too complex slows down the process of connecting lines and tracing paths. Colours for the lines can be set by either &lt;styleUrl&gt; colour elements in the KML file or <em>grid_colour</em> Colour options, where <em>colour</em> equals the lines' &lt;styleUrl&gt;, e.g.<em>grid_s_66kv=#774110</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>grid_network2</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A KML file defining the actual grid network. Any string of &lt;coordinates&gt; in a &lt;LineString&gt; is used to draw a grid line. &lt;styleUrl&gt; colour elements may be used for the line colour. Alternatively, a standard set of colours based upon line capacity, as defined by &lt;SimpleData name="CAPACITY_kV"&gt; elements, can be used. These values can be set by <em>grid2_line_capacity</em> Colour properties where <em>line_capacity</em> is the line capacity, e.g. <em>grid2_66=#774110</em> for a 66kV line. It can be a detailed as you like and doesn't require accurate connections (SIREN makes no use of it)</td>

<p>Among other publicly available resources, MapQuest provides a set of open aerial map tiles which can be stitched together into a single image. Map data &copy; OpenStreetMap contributors CC-BY-SA <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank"> http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</a>.</p>
<h4>getmap</h4>
<p><i>getmap.py</i> is a Python program that can be used to create a map image for any area of the globe. Using this program you specify the bounding coordinates for the chosen area, a zoom level and a name for the file to create a suitable map image. You can invoke the program either by choosing <em>getmap</em> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <em>getmap.exe</em> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to allow you to define the map/image desired. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Area of interest</em>. You specify the boundaries for the area of the world you want a map generated for. You can either use the arrows to increase or decrease each coordinate by 5 degrees or type in a value. North and South can range from -85 to +85 degrees and East and West from -180 to +180</li>
<li><em>Map Scale (Zoom)</em>. The scale of the map can be from 0 - 1:500 million - to 11 - 1:250,000. These are the scale of maps available from MapQuest. You can either use the arrows to increase or decrease the level or type in a value. The program will show an approximate scale for the level chosen</li>
<li><em>Image File name</em>. Use this to specify the name and location for the map file. If you click on the field it will allow you to specify an alternative name and location for the file (you can't type into the field itself). If you specify a filetype it must be a suitable image format. The default format is <em>.png</em></li>
<li><em>Properties</em>. This is a read only field that is filled in when a map is created. These properties should be copied into the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Query Map</em> will calculate the size of the map and indicate the boundaries for the map</li>
<li><em>Get Map</em> will produce the map. It downloads map tiles from MapQuest and stitches them into a single image file at the location specified. It will update the Properties field with the valuables to be added into the Preferences file. If you are downloading a map with many tile this may take some time so <strong>please be patient</strong></li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>After producing the map you should copy the contents of the <em>Properties</em> field into the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file.</p>

<h3 id="swisupd">Obtaining Current SWIS Facilities</h3>
<p>The initial SWIS data provided with SIREN is for 2014 and 2015 with existing renewable stations at that time. Updates to this data are available on the <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/" target="_blank">AEMO Market Data website</a>. The SWIS data used by SIREN is as follows.</p>
<h4>SWIS Network</h4>
<p>SIREN uses a simplified network to reduce the overhead in adding stations into the network and to trace there links to the Perth Load Centre. This simple network was derived from a national network diagram for Australia available as a KML file from Geoscience Australia (<a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/83105/NationalElectricityTransmissionLines.kml" target="_blank">National Electricity Transmission Lines</a>; accessed Nov 2015)</p>
<p>There is also a list of Australian power stations available as a KML file (<a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/82326/NationalMajorPowerStations.kml" target="_blank">NationalMajorPowerStations</a>; accessed Nov 2015)</p>
<h4 id="updateswis">Existing Stations (Facilities)</h4>
<p>SIREN uses the list of <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facilities" target="_blank">registered facilities</a> available from AEMO (specifically <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/datafiles/facilities/facilities.csv" target="_blank">facilities.csv</a>) for it's existing stations. If you want an updated version you can use <em>updateswis</em> to obtain the current list.</p>
<h5>updateswis</h5>
<p><em>updateswis.py</em> is a Python program that can be used to access the current list of facilities (power stations) for the SWIS. The program will download the list of existing stations and optionally update the file SIREN uses for existing stations (<em>grid_stations</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file. To aid readability you can optionally produce an additional file, Excel or CSV, that will save the list in the same format as a SIREN scenario file. You can invoke the program either by choosing <em>updateswis</em> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <em>updateswis.exe</em> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Host site</em>. The URL of the AEMO Market Data website</li>
<li><em>File location</em>. The location of the file on the AEMO Market Data website</li>
<li><em>Target File</em>. The target file for the existing stations. The tool will examine and existing file and evaluate what changes have been made. The file name is derived from the <em>grid_stations</em> property</li>
<li><em>Excel file</em>. Setting a file name here will cause an additional file to be created in SIREN scenario format</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Update Existing Stations</em> will download the current file on the AEMO site and compare it to the existing list available to SIREN. If there are changes you will be presented with a brief summary of changes and given the option to replace the existing file. The initial window will then be displayed with a brief message</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>updateswis.exe</em> &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>

<h4>Load Data</h4>
<p>The load data for the SWIS has been obtained from <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#load-summary" target="_blank">Load Summary</a> data available from AEMO. SIREN use hourly load data rather than half hourly. This figures we use are derived by summing the &lsquo;Operational Load (MWh)&rsquo; data for the two half hourly intervals.</p>

<h3 id="merra">Obtaining and Using NASA MERRA-2 Data for SAM</h3>
<h4 id="merra1">Using NASA MERRA-2 Data for input to SAM</h4>
<p>SAM uses meteorological and solar data to model output of various renewable energy technologies.
NASA MERRA-2 data is a suitable source to generate data files containing all weather variables required for input to SAM. It allows weather files to be created on a grid of 0.625 degree of longitude by 0.5 degree of latitude. This is approximately an area of 55 Km x 55 Km for the SWIS latitudes.</p>
<p>Initial correlations between generation calculated by SAM models using NASA MERRA data and actual observations from BOM data obtained by SEN in 2014 are strong enough to support the use of NASA MERRA-derived data for the purposes of the simulation. Average correlation was 0.77, varying from 0.70 to 0.83 for wind and 0.95 for the one utility scale PV farm on the SWIS network. The following figure graphically presents this correlation by showing progressive calculated generation (solid lines) with actual SCADA data (dotted lines) for each renewable generation station on the SWIS.</p>
<p>
<img src="scada_vs_sam_2014_detailed.png" alt="Correlation">
</p>
<p>Two MERRA-2 data files are appropriate for our needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx</em> for wind</li>
<li><em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx</em> for solar</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>tavg1_2d_flx_Nx</em>, <em>tavg1_2d_lnd_Nx</em> or <em>tavg1_2d_mld_Nx</em> for rainfall (experimental)</li>
</div>
</ul>
<h4 id="merra2">Obtaining MERRA-2 Data</h4>
<p>MERRA-2 Data is publicly available and the following steps can be used to obtain the required data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the MERRA-2 data subset URL, <a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/FTPSubset2.pl" target="_blank">http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/FTPSubset2.pl</a> in your browser
<li>Within the MDISC Data Subset page choose appropriate options as follows:

<li>Data Product<br/>
Select Data Product from the pulldown list:
<ol>
<li>MERRA-2 <em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx</em> for wind</li>
<li>MERRA-2 <em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx</em> for solar</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li>MERRA-2 <em>tavg1_2d_flx_Nx</em>, <em>tavg1_2d_lnd_Nx</em> or <em>tavg1_2d_mld_Nx</em> for rainfall (experimental)</li>
</div>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Spatial Search<br/>
Select area of interest. For the SWIS choose:<br/>
<em>W: 113 N:-26 S: -37 E: 123</em><br/>
Press <em>Update Map</em> to check geographic spread
</li>
<li>
Temporal Order Option<br/>
Select range of dates. It is most convenient to select full years. As times are UTC we need the last last day of the prior period (year) to obtain data for the initial hours of the first day in the local time-zone (8 hours for WA)
</li>
<li>
Parameters<br/>
To reduce the size of the data files select just those variables we need:
<ol>
<li>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx<br>
<em>ps u10m u2m u50m v10m v2m v50m t10m t2m</em></li>
<li>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx<br>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Output File Format<br/>
Select <em>NetCDF</em> from the pulldown list
</li>
<li>
Press <em>Start Search</em>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Follow the instruction on the resulting FTP Subset Results page
<ol>
<li>
Save the list of URLs
</li>
<li>
Copy the file to the sub-folder you want the files downloaded to
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Open a terminal window and navigate to the sub-folder you want the files downloaded to
<ol>
<li>
Run the wget command as displayed in the FTP Subset Results page. This uses the downloaded list. You can copy and paste the command into the terminal window. The command will be something like<br/>
<em>wget --content-disposition -i wget_...</em>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process uses <em>wget</em> to download the MERRA-2 data files. Typically there is a single file for each day of interest so using wget simplifies the process of downloading them. Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet protocols. There are versions available for most platforms.</p>
<h4 id="merra3">Produce wind and solar files</h4>
<h5>makeweather2</h5>
<p><em>makeweather2.py</em> is a Python program that can be used to produce solar and/or wind weather files for input to SAM. The program generates SMW (preferred for SAM) or CSV format solar resource files and SRW format wind resource files. These file formats have been chosen as they're easier to generate than other formats. Using the program you specify the source folder for the MERRA-2 data files, the time zone for the area of interest, a file format and target folder for the weather files. The program will generate files for each of the MERRA-2 grid squares within the chosen MERRA-2 data files or optionally for a number of latitude and longitude positions. You can invoke the program either by choosing <em>makeweather2</em> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <em>makeweather2.exe</em> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. Year of interest. The naming conventions for MERRA-2 files include the date so this defines the date range. The tool processes dates from the last day of the prior year through to the first day of the next year (ignoring 29 February)</li>
<li><em>Time Zone</em>. The (solar) time zone for the area of interest. This is used to create suitable weather files where the first hour in the file is the first hour of the year in the local time zone. A value of <em>auto</em> will cause the program to use the (first) longitude in the MERRA-2 data files to calculate the time zone</li>
<li><em>Solar Format</em>. The solar option can produce weather files in either of two formats - SMW or CSV format. This option allows you to choose your preferred one. SMW format is suitable for SAM while it may have trouble with the CSV format</li>
<li><em>Coordinates</em>. Rather than producing weather files for each grid cell in the chosen area you can restrict it by passing a string of comma-separated latitude and longitude values. The tool will then generate files for just these coordinates</li>
<li><em>Copy folder down</em>. This is an ease of use field. If this is checked any changes to the Solar Source Folder field will be propagated to the other two Folder fields</li>
<li><em>Solar Source Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the MERRA-2 solar (<em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx</em>) files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field). This location is only used for solar files</li>
<li><em>Wind Source Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the MERRA-2 wind (<em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx</em>) files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field). This location is used for both solar and wind files so you need to specify it in all cases</li>
<li><em>Target Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the weather files produced by the tool. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are five buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Solar Files</em> will produce solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Produce Wind Files</em> will produce wind weather files</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
<li><em>File Info</em> Display details about the weather file dimensions and variables</li>
</ul>
<p>Creation of weather files may take some time so please be patient. The tool will produce an output report which will include the list of weather files produced. The report will include a return code as follows:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li value="0">Successful execution</li>
<li value="1">Successful execution, however, the time zone chosen does not match the time zone(s) suggested by the MERRA-2 data files. If you chose <em>auto</em> this indicates more than one time zone is suggested by the MERRA-2 data files</li>
<li value="4">Error with coordinates field</li>
<li value="8">Invalid output file format specified. It must be one of <em>csv</em>, <em>smw</em>, <em>srw</em>, or <em>wind</em></li>
<li value="12">MERRA-2 data file not found. The program requires file name(s) to be in a specific format so either the file name doesn't match that format or the source folder is incorrect</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>makeweather2.exe</em> &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>year=</em> Year of interest</li>
<li><em>zone=</em> or <em>timezone=</em> The (solar) time zone for the area of interest</li>
<li><em>fmat=</em> Weather file format</li>
<li><em>coords=</em> or <em>latlon=</em> A string of comma-separated latitude and longitude values</li>
<li><em>solar=</em> Location of the MERRA-2 solar (<em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx</em>) files</li>
<li><em>wind=</em> Location of the MERRA-2 wind (<em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx</em>) files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> or <em>tgtdir=</em> Location for the weather files produced</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The program should also handle MERRA (version 1) data files downloaded (probably) prior to February 2016.</p>
<p>
<h5 id="merra4">Wind Files</h5>
<p>SRW format wind files are one of the formats acceptable to SAM. This format has been chosen as it's easier to generate than other formats. MERRA-2 variables from tavg1_2d_slv_Nx data files are used to create the SRW variables.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. Year of interest. The naming conventions for MERRA-2 files include the date so this defines the date range. The tool processes dates from the last day of the prior year through to the first day of the next year (ignoring 29 February)</li>
<li><em>Time Zone</em>. The (solar) time zone for the area of interest. This is used to create suitable weather files where the first hour in the file is the first hour of the year in the local time zone. A value of <em>auto</em> will cause the program to use the (first) longitude in the MERRA-2 data files to calculate the time zone</li>
<li><em>File Format</em>. The MERRA-2 input file format. This is three-letter group mnemonic - <em>flx</em>, <em>lnd</em> or <em>mld</em></li>
<li><em>Coordinates</em>. Rather than producing weather files for each grid cell in the chosen area you can restrict it by passing a string of comma-separated latitude and longitude values. The tool will then generate files for just these coordinates</li>
<li><em>Copy folder down</em>. This is an ease of use field. If this is checked any changes to the Rainfall Source Folder field will be propagated to the Target Folder fields</li>
<li><em>Rainfall Source Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the MERRA-2 source files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field)</li>
<li><em>Target Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the weather files produced by the tool. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Rainfall Files</em> will produce rainfall weather files</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>Creation of weather files may take some time so please be patient. The tool will produce an output report which will include the list of weather files produced. The report will include a return code as follows:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li value="0">Successful execution</li>
<li value="1">Successful execution, however, the time zone chosen does not match the time zone(s) suggested by the MERRA-2 data files. If you chose <em>auto</em> this indicates more than one time zone is suggested by the MERRA-2 data files</li>
<li value="4">Error with coordinates field</li>
<li value="8">Invalid output file format specified. It must be either <em>csv</em> or <em>rainfall</em></li>
<li value="12">MERRA-2 data file not found. The program requires file name(s) to be in a specific format so either the file name doesn't match that format or the source folder is incorrect</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>makerainfall2.exe</em> &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>year=</em> Year of interest</li>
<li><em>zone=</em> or <em>timezone=</em> The (solar) time zone for the area of interest</li>
<li><em>fmat=</em> Weather file format</li>
<li><em>coords=</em> or <em>latlon=</em> A string of comma-separated latitude and longitude values</li>
<li><em>source=</em> Location of the MERRA-2 source files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> or <em>tgtdir=</em> Location for the weather files produced</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The program should also handle MERRA (version 1) data files downloaded (probably) prior to February 2016.</p>
<h5 id="merrar2">Rainfall Files</h5>
<p>MERRA-2 variables from tavg1_2d_flx_Nx, tavg1_2d_lnd_Nx, or avg1_2d_mld_Nx data files are used to create a CSV format file with a single Rainfall variable.</p>

<h3 id="index">Using other Weather Files</h3>
<p>The use of MERRA data for the weather files is not necessary but provides a way of obtaining (gridded) weather data for any geographic area. Any weather files suitable for SAM can be used by SIREN. <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/weather" target="_blank">Weather Data</a> describes these file formats and <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/content/weather-data-non-us-locations" target="_blank">Weather Data for non-U.S. Locations</a> gives some details on where non-U.S. weather data may be obtained.</p>
<p>SIREN has two approaches for obtaining weather files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having the geographic location of the file as part of the file name. This option uses file name formats of &lt;location_latitude_longitude_year&gt; and includes files created from MERRA-2 data by <em>makeweather2</em>. The location for weather files for solar and wind are defined by the <em>solar_files</em> and <em>wind_files</em> properties in the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>By using an index file. To use other files you need to create index files that contain the latitude, longitude and file name for each weather file, where the filename is relative to the location for the weather files. Index files for solar and wind are defined by the <em>solar_index</em> and <em>wind_index</em> properties. You can either create these files manually or use <em>indexweather</em> to create an index</li>
</ol>
<h5>indexweather</h5>
<p><em>indexweather.py</em> is a Python program that can be used to create an index of solar and/or wind weather files for input to SAM. The program generates an index file that contains latitude, longitude and file name for each weather file. You can invoke the program either by choosing <em>indexweather</em> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <em>indexweather.exe</em> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Solar files</em>. Location of solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Solar index</em>. Name and location for solar index file</li>
<li><em>Wind files</em>. Location of wind weather files</li>
<li><em>Wind index</em>. Name and location for wind index file</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Solar Index</em> will produce a solar index file</li>
<li><em>Produce Wind Index</em> will produce a wind index file</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>indexweather.exe</em> &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>solar=</em> Location of the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>wind=</em> Location of the wind weather files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> name of the index file to produce</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="resource">Visualising Renewable Resource Attributes</h3>
<p>To assist with placement of renewable energy stations SIREN can display a grid of renewable resource attributes derived from the SAM format weather files. This feature utilises summary data stored in a file rather than having to process hourly data from the weather files. The weather data values available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DHI (Diffuse)</em>. Average daily DHI insolation (W)</li>
<li><em>DNI (Normal)</em>. Average daily DNI insolation (W). Important for Solar Thermal generation</li>
<li><em>GHI (Direct)</em>. Average daily GHI insolation (W). Important for PV generation</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>Rainfall</em>. Average hourly rainfall (mm) (experimental)</li>
</div>
<li><em>Temperature</em>. Average hourly temperature (<sup>o</sup>C)</li>
<li><em>Wind Speed</em>. Average hourly wind speed at 10m height (m/s)</li>
<li><em>Wind @ 50m</em>. Average hourly wind speed at 50m height (m/s). Important for Wind generation</li>
</ul>
<p>The Resource Grid window allows you to choose the period and weather variable to display and how it will appear on the SIREN map. By default the period can be either the full year, a month or a season. If there are appropriate files you can also display the variable for an hour within a month or a day. The window also has a <em>Next</em> button which allows you to &ldquo;step&rdquo; through the weather periods. You can also use <em>Page Down</em> and <em>Page Up</em> to step forward and back through the weather periods.</p>
<p>The resource files, created by <em>makegrid</em>, summarise weather data for each grid cell to avoid having to process each weather file to obtain the data for the desired time period or hour. There are three possible levels of detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily By Month (default). These files summarise the average daily figures for a year, month or season. It provides a gross view to see variances at the monthly level. This is a single spreadsheet with a very approximate disk requirement of about 11Kb per cell</li>
<li>Hourly By Month. These files summarise the average hourly figures for each month. It provides hourly variances at the monthly level. This is a spreadsheet for each month with a very approximate disk requirement of about 190Kb per cell (15Kb per month)</li>
<li>Hourly By Day. These files have hourly figures for each day. It provides hourly variances at the daily level. This is a spreadsheet for each day with a very approximate disk requirement of about 5.8Mb per cell (15Kb per day). It allows you to visualise the actual movement of weather events (sun, wind fronts) at the expense of significantly larger disk storage requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>makegrid</h4>
<p><i>makegrid.py</i> is a Python program that can be used to create the resource grid file used by SIREN. You can invoke the program in Windows by running <em>makegrid.exe</em> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to allow you to define what file to create. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. Year of interest</li>
<li><em>Update year</em>. If this is checked changes to the year selected will be propagated to the two Folder and Resource File fields</li>
<li><em>Level of Detail</em>. Specify the resource files to be created. Values are:- Daily By Month, Hourly By Month, or Hourly By Day</li>
<li><em>Solar Folder</em>. Source folder for the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Wind Folder</em>. Source folder for the wind weather files</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>Rain Folder</em>. Source folder for the rain weather files (experimental)</li>
</div>
<li><em>Resource File</em>. Target file. This can be either a CSV or Excel file. For an Excel file if you append <em>$MM$</em> to the year in the file name hourly variable values will be produced</li>
<li><em>Properties</em>. This is a read only field that is filled in when the file is created. This property should be copied into the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Resource File</em> will produce the file</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>After producing the file you may want to copy contents of the <em>Properties</em> field into the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file.</p>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>makegrid.exe</em> &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>year=</em> Year of interest</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>rain=</em> Location of the rain weather files (experimental)</li>
</div>
<li><em>solar=</em> Location of the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>wind=</em> Location of the wind weather files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> or <em>tgtfil=</em> Resource grid file to be produced</li>
</ul>
<p>If the source folder(s) contains other CSV files <em>makegrid</em> may fail. If this happens it is probably safer to copy the weather files to a separate folder.

<h3 id="sam">SAM Models used by SIREN</h3>
<p>SIREN uses the NREL SAM SDK API for energy calculations. This is a collection of tools developed by NREL for creating renewable energy system models. See <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/sdk" target="_blank">SAM Simulation Core SDK</a> for details on the SDK. NREL also provide a user-friendly front end, <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">SAM</a>, to facilitate usage of the SAM models.</p>
<p>The SAM models are very comprehensive and can be quite complex. For example, there are around 200 input variables possible for the Solar Thermal model SIREN uses. To simplify the interface to SAM, SIREN uses a variable file for each technology to store default values for most variables and only requires a minimal number of variables to be set by the user, such as Capacity. The models used by SIREN and their variable files are as follows:</p>
<table class="none">

<h4>Using the full power of SAM</h4>
<p>It is possible to use the full capabilities of SAM by one of two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use SAM:
<ol>
<li>Run the appropriate model and parameters for the station of interest</li>
<li>Save the hourly power generation figures produce by SAM</li>
<li>Update the Power File field for the station to point this file</li>
<li>Rather than running the Power Model SIREN will access this data file to obtain the hourly figures</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a specific variables file for the technology you're interested in</li>
<ol>
<li>Using the existing file as a starting point create you own version of the file. The structure of the file is generally self-explanatory. Most of the file is created from the SDK with an addition <em>DEFAULT</em> column </li>
<li>Update the appropriate property in the <a href="#p_sam_modules">[SAM Modules]</a> Section of the Preferences file to point to your file</li>
<li>SIREN will then use your file to process that technology</li>
<li>If you require different options for different stations with the same technology you can use the <em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> option to save the output for each station. Using <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> you can create a more specific file</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<div class="experiment">
<h3 id="nonsam">Other Models used by SIREN (experimental)</h3>
<p>SIREN will support models to accommodate other technologies not supported by SAM models. As well as this it is possible to provide a list of generation figures for a Station using the <em>Power File</em> field (see <a href="#stations">Stations</a>).
<h4>Hydro</h4>
<p>The Hydro model used in SIREN is a very simplistic model computed by multiplying station capacity by the defined capacity factor for Hydro.</p>
<h4>Wave</h4>
<p>The Wave model used in SIREN is (currently) a very simplistic model computed using wind speed (after Bretschneider and Sverdrup and Munk):
<p><code>
Wave_Height = 0.023 * 0.3048 * (Wind_Speed * 1.94384)<sup>2</sup></code>&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.3048 converts feet to metres, 1.94384 converts knots to m/s)
<br /><code>Wave_Period = 0.45 * Wind_Speed * 1.94384
<br />Wave_Power = Wave_Height<sup>2</sup> * Wave_Period * Efficiency of technology
</code>

<p>There is no constraint (such as being in water) on where Stations may be placed. The CFs are probably too high but can be reduced by capping wave height (<em>[Wave] cutout</em>) to, say, around 2.?m</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>SIREN will also support creation of you own model to support other technologies. The approach is to execute a model formula that you create for each of the 8,760 hours of appropriate weather data to calculate the power produced for that hour. The formula can be created by referencing each of the weather data variables, any other variables you define for that technology plus normal mathematical operators (refer to <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math#Mathematical_Operators" target="_blank">en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math#Mathematical_Operators</a>). The weather variables recognised are: <em>dhi</em>, <em>dni</em>, <em>ghi</em>, <em>temp</em>, <em>wind</em>, and <em>wind50</em>. To achieve this you need to:
<ol>
<li>Identify the technology by giving it a name of <em>Other</em> plus a suffix, say <em>Other1</em> and create a Section with that name in the Preferences file</li>
<li>Create appropriate Properties for that technology and any other variables you want for it (see the <a href="#p_other">[Other]</a> Section in the Preferences file)</li>
<li>There are standard Properties of <em>area</em>, <em>capital_cost</em>, <em>icon</em>, and <em>o_m_cost</em>.</li>
<li>The formula is identified by the <em>formula</em> Property. Any calculated value will be capped at 1 to prevent a CF greater than 1</li>
<li>Add the technology (lower case) as a colour Property in the <a href="#p_color">[Color]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>Add the technology (lower case) to the <em>technologies</em> Property in the <a href="#power">[Power]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>If the technology can be regarded as dispatchable you can also add it to the <em>dispatchable</em> Property in the <a href="#p_grid">[Grid]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
</ol>
</p>The following sample defines a technology, Other1, similar to the Wave model (above but with no cutout).
<p><code>
[Other1]
<br />area=&lt;area per MW&gt;
<br />capital_cost&lt;Capital cost per peak MW&gt;
<br />efficiency=&lt;technology efficiency&gt;
<br />o_m_cost=&lt;Operations and Maintenance cost per peak MW&gt;
<br />formula=pow(0.0070104 * ( wind * 1.94384)**2,2) * 0.45 * wind * 1.94384 * efficiency * .125
