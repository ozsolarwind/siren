<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to SEN's renewable energy conceptual simulation - SIREN.</p>
<p>The worlds renewable energy resources could provide many times the amount of fossil-fuelled energy currently used. SEN's computer simulation models an electricity network and allows you to create, cost and evaluate scenarios for supplying electricity using a mixture of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>By placing virtual renewable energy plants around the area of interest, you will be able to determine the optimal locations to access renewable energy sources, minimise grid connection costs and meet the varying demand on the grid, while achieving the best in terms of efficiency, cost effectiveness and energy security.</p>
<p>This version of the Simulation uses the SAM SDK API for energy calculations. SAM is provided by the NREL.</p>
<h3>Southern Western Australia (WA)</h3>
<p>The default data provided with SIREN is for the SWIS in southern WA but the program(s) have been constructed to cover any geographic area with the appropriate input files. The techniques to create the required data files is documented in <a href="#notes">Supporting Notes</a>.</p>
<h3>About SEN</h3>
Sustainable Energy NOW, SEN (<a href="http://sen.asn.au" target="_blank">sen.asn.au</a>), is a not-for-profit association incorporated in Western Australia (WA) with a focus on renewable energy.
<p><strong>Our Definition of Sustainable Energy</strong>: &ldquo;Energy that is renewable within a human lifetime and can be produced safely and equitably for all time with minimal impact on the environment and future inhabitants&rdquo;. We believe this does not include nuclear power with its many unresolved issues.</p>
<p><strong>Our Focus</strong>: To raise awareness of how a mix of renewable energy technologies are able to meet WA's energy needs, with a particular focus on the main electricity grid, the SWIS.</p>
<p><strong>Our Computer Simulation (SIREN)</strong>: To demonstrate how electricity demand on the SWIS may be met by a mix of renewable energy sources. Users are able to explore potential location and scale of renewable energy sources (stations, storage, transmission) to meet electricity demand.</p>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p>At present there is a packaged version of the simulation for Windows available as a self-extracting zip file from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/</a> (the package has been created with PyInstaller). There are a number of files available:
<ul>
<li><code>siren_toolkit.exe</code> contains the full SIREN toolkit, It contains the contents of three other files in this list</li>
<li><code>siren_application.exe</code> contains the packaged Windows version of the SIREN application</li>
<li><code>siren_sample.exe</code> contains the files and data for the sample SIREN simulation of the SWIS</li>
<li>(<code>sen_makeweather_getera.exe</code> is a package containing <code>getera5</code>, which enables ERA5 files to be downloaded, <code>getmerra2</code>, which enables MERRA-2 files to be downloaded, and <code>makeweatherfiles</code>, a standalone program to produce SAM weather files. This package allows you to create SAM weather files from either ERA5 or MERRA-2 files without requiring any other parts of SIREN. See <a href="makeweatherfiles.html" target="_blank">makeweatherfiles.html</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally new versions of some of the SIREN programs will be uploaded to SourceForge. You can check for new versions and download them by selecting the <code>sirenupd</code> option in SIREN. (Major new releases can also be indicated but these will require a complete new SIREN version to be installed.)</p>
<p>To install the required package you can just open/launch it and extract it to your desired location. It may be necessary to execute the program as Administrator.</p>
<p>It is also possible to install and run the Python programs. <a href="https://github.com/ozsolarwind/siren/blob/master/SIREN_notes.html" target="_blank">SIREN_Notes.html</a> provides some guidance on how to do this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This help file may refer to individual programs either with or without the program suffix, for example <code>sirenm</code>, <code>sirenm.exe</code> or <code>sirenm.py</code>. You may have to use the appropriate suffix for your environment.
<h3>Possible folder setup for SIREN</h3>
<p>To enable new versions of SIREN to be installed without affecting your work a folder structure similar to the following is suggested.</p>
<table border="0", class="none">
<tr class="none"><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Your Folder</td><td class="none">&nbsp;</td><td class="none">&nbsp;</td><td class="none">&nbsp;</td><td class="none">Extract siren_application.exe here</td></tr>

</table>
<p>You can indicate the location of your SIREN Models in one of two ways.
<ol>
<li>Set up a (Desktop) Shortcut with the following Target to invoke SIREN (see below for further details):
<pre>
      "C:\..Your Folder\siren\siren.exe"
</pre>
</li>
<li>Using the folder structure above as an example, set up a (Desktop) Shortcut with the following Target to invoke SIREN:
<pre>
      "C:\..Your Folder\siren\siren.exe" "..\models"
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When setting up files and folders in your Preferences file (documented in <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>) you can use relative addresses to point to the correct location. The addresses are relative to the <em>siren</em> folder. For example:
<pre>
      [Parents]
      $user1=../Your model
      ...
      [Files]
      solar_files=$user1/weather_files
      ...
</pre>
<h3 id="execute">Execution of SIREN</h3>
<p>To execute the simulation open <code>siren.exe</code> in the upper folder, <em>siren</em>. You can easily set up a Desktop shortcut to point to the model. The package contains a number of folders with default files, some that can be replaced with your own. The location of these files are defined in a Preferences file as documented in <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>. The default files are located in the following folders:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>siren_files</em> contains a range of files to enable operation of the simulation</li>
<li><em>sam-sdk</em> contains a Windows version of the SAM SDK, <em>sam-sdk-206_2018.11.11_r2</em></li>
<li><em>source</em> contains the Python source programs for SIREN</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time you open SIREN (without passing a target file or folder) it will present a window titled &lsquo;Choose location for SIREN model (preferences) files&rsquo; to allow you to choose the location for your SIREN Models. SIREN stores this location in <code>siren_models_location.txt</code> in a user folder and uses this as the location of the SIREN Models whenever you invoke SIREN without a target file or location. In windows the file is stored in the user's LocalAppData folder, <code>C:\User\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\siren\</code>, and in Linux it is in <code>~/.siren/</code>. The file contains a single line with the location of the folder respective to the <em>siren</em> folder. It is possible to edit the file and manually add additional folders if desired.</p>
<p>When you open SIREN you will be presented with a list of SIREN Models (Preferences files). Choose the SIREN Model you want by (left-) clicking on your choice. It is also possible to launch tools for the model by right-clicking on your choice - the tools are as described in <a href="#tools">Tools</a> - or you can edit the Model file. You can sort the list presented in order of either Preferences File, SIREN Model or Date modified (last time the Preferences file was saved) by right-clicking the appropriate column header. If a Model file has a syntax error this will be identified in the SIREN Model field; editing such a file will, where possible, highlight the line in error. If you want to use a specific Preferences file you can open the simulation passing the alternate filename, or a folder, as a parameter, as in these examples:</p>
<pre>
      siren.exe
      siren.exe SIREN_NWIS.ini
      siren.exe ../&lt;folder&gt;/SIREN_NWIS.ini
      siren.exe ../&lt;folder with preferences files&gt;/
</pre>
<p>If you specify a folder you will be presented with a list of SIREN Models (Preferences files) in that folder. You can either specify the folder as the full path or relative to the siren folder. Placing your models in a separate folder will make it easier to install updates to SIREN without impacting your data files.</p>
<p>If you want to create a new Model press the <em>New Model</em> button on the start up menu. You will be presented with a small list of Properties to update to create a new Preferences file. Many of these properties relate to files and file locations as described in <a href="#setup">Setting Up</a>. It's important to ensure they're correct for the new model to open. For the file fields click on the field to navigate to the desired file or folder. At the bottom of the Create Preferences file menu you have options to Save the new file, Save the new file and edit it, or Save it and open (launch) the new model. If you specified a folder when you opened SIREN, the new model will be saved in that folder.</p>
<p>When you launch a SIREN model you may receive either a warning message or a status window indicating possible issues with the Preferences file (Notes in <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a> might assist).</p>

<h3 id="sample">Sample SIREN Model</h3>
<p>The sample SIREN model for the SWIS for 2014 and 2015. The default Preferences files, <em>SIREN.ini</em>, is set up for this data and assumes the <em>siren_sample</em> folder is located in the same parent folder as the <em>siren</em> folder. The sample data contains:
<ul class="none">
<li><em>sample_files</em> contains a range of files for the SWIS such as maps, existing network and so forth</li>
<li><em>solar_weather</em> contains solar (.smw) weather files for the SWIS for 2014 and 2015</li>
<li><em>wind_weather</em> contains wind (.srw) weather files for the SWIS for 2014 and 2015</li>
</ul>
<div class="experiment">
<h3>Experimental features</h3>
<p>There are some experimental features in SIREN which may or may not be further developed. These are identified within this help by a red bounding box.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="setup">Setting Up</h2>
<p>The simulation uses external data files to model the potential for renewable energy generation for a geographic region. The approach is to model the data on an hourly basis for a desired year (ignoring leap days, that is, 8,760 hours). The following data files are required / desirable. Due to the initial source for each data file the format for each is different (see <a href="#files">SIREN File Formats</a> for further details). Please <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> any desired formats as it's relatively easy to accommodate standard file formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A map of the area of interest (identified in the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file). A simple JPEG or PNG image is fine although most conventional image formats should be acceptable. The map covers a geographically &ldquo;rectangular&rdquo; area of the earth. Obtaining a suitable map image is described in <a href="#map">Obtaining a Suitable Map Image</a></li>
<li>Names and locations of towns. Two files are used as input (either or both can be specified):
<ol>
<li>Either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file containing a list of weather stations from the BOM (identified by <em>bom</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</li>
<li>Either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file containing the location of additional towns or localities (identified by <em>towns</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Names, technologies and locations of existing power stations (identified by <em>grid_stations</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This is either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file which contains details of existing Facilities (Stations) registered with the local electricity regulator (AEMO in the case of the SWIS) augmented by geographic location of the station and details on turbines for wind farms. The CSV file may be either a specific format or a normal scenario file. You can update this file for the SWIS as described in <a href="#swisupd">Obtaining Current SWIS Facilities</a>.
<br>
You can also create additional stations, such as Rooftop PV, to be included in the list of existing stations by creating an additional Stations file and setting the <em>grid_stations2</em> property in the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>A layout of the existing electrical grid. A KML file showing the layout of the major power lines in the grid and another with the outline of the network (SWIS) boundary. This should be a simplified version of the grid network with all lines connecting exactly for SIREN to correctly connect new stations into the grid
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The intention of these two files is to describe the existing fossil and renewable Stations on the electricity network</li>
<li>Optionally, the network can be divided into zones. This enables different renewable energy potential between zones to be analysed and utilised by <a href="#powermatch">Powermatch</a></li>
<li>Hourly load details for the electricity grid. Either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file with a single column of electrical load data for the 8,760 hours in the year of interest (identified by <em>load</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). Each value is for one hour of load commencing on that hour.</li>
<li>Hourly solar and weather details for the area of interest (identified by <em>solar_files</em> and <em>wind_files</em> properties of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This data is in formats required for input to SAM and contains entries for the 8,760 hours in the year of interest. A SAM weather file is a text file that contains one (calendar) year's worth of data describing the solar resource, wind speed, temperature, and other weather characteristics at a particular location. The approach we have adopted is to use NASA MERRA-2 data for the desired geographic area and year to create appropriately formatted weather files. This is described in <a href="#merra">Obtaining and Using NASA MERRA-2 Data for SAM weather files</a>. To enable more recent (part-year) data to be used it is possible to &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; the data by using the weather data for the prior year for the remaining part of the year.
<br>
You can also use TMY files such as those provided with SAM. If you have a number of weather files you can create an index of these files for SIREN. This is described in <a href="#index">Using other Weather Files</a></li>
<li>SIREN allows you to visualise renewable resource attributes. This utilises a summary file to avoid having to process all the weather files covered by the map (identified by <em>resource_grid</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). This is described in <a href="#resource">Visualising Renewable Resource Attributes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can successfully use the simulation with just the map and weather data while existing load and network data enhance it's usefulness.
<h3>A note about hours</h3>
<p>Due to inconsistency between power (SAM) and weather data / files, hours of the day are portrayed differently. For example, looking at the hour between midnight and 1:00AM:- in power data the hour is shown as the start of the hour, <em>00:00</em>, while for weather data it is the end of the hour, <em>01:00</em>.</p>

<h2 id="objects">Simulation Objects</h2>
<p>The simulation has two main objects, stations and grid lines. Stations can be saved as scenarios in either an Excel (XLS) or CSV file format while grid lines are constructed during the simulation rather than being saved to a file (unless you have manually created the grid line).</p>
<h3 id="stations">Stations</h3>
<p>Stations represent either existing generation stations on the grid or new ones you have created during a simulation session. The station files can be updated outside of the simulation. The fields for a station are:</p>

The default is N for southern latitude stations and S for northern latitude (that is, towards the midday sun)</td>

<p>When you display a Station with SIREN it will also show the Scenario the Station is in. For new Stations (i.e. not Existing) it is possible to update this value to one of the other scenarios that are currently &ldquo;open&ldquo;. This will move the Station into that scenario and, if the scenario is saved move it permanently into that Scenario.</p>
<h3 id="gridlines">Grid Lines</h3>
<p>Grid lines connect new stations to either existing or other new grid lines. By default the grid line will connect a station to the nearest point on the grid. You can edit a grid line if you wish to connect it elsewhere in the grid. Grid lines are recalculated when you add or modify stations but are not normally saved. You can, however, list the (new) grid lines and save the table listed. The fields for a grid are:</p>

</tr>
</table>
<h3 id="grid">Types of Grid Lines</h3>
<p>A grid is built up of a number of different types of line to enable differing loads to be carried. Each line has a maximum carrying capacity. Greater loads require additional lines to be added; so in this simulation one line may represent multiple grid lines as described in the <em>Line Table</em> for the line. For dispatchable transmission we need an extra path for backup purposes (N-1) while no such backup is required for non-dispatchable loads (N-0). For a line carrying both we'll use a criteria of N-0 for total load plus N-1 for dispatchable load. Within this simulation line types and costs can be specified (somewhat cryptically) in the <a href="#p_grid">[Grid]</a> Section of the Preferences file. The default set of lines are:</p>

<h2 id="prefs">Preferences</h2>
<p>Many options can be specified by a Preferences file. When you open SIREN you will be presented with a list of available Preferences files (SIREN Models) to choose from. These files reside in the same folder as SIREN itself (they may be placed in a different folder by passing that folder as a parameter when SIREN is invoked).
The format is similar to a Windows INI file. If you want to create a new Model you can press the <em>New Model</em> button on the start up menu. You will be presented with a small list of Properties to update to create a new Preferences file.
<p>The Preferences file has the following Sections and properties. The file is a simple text file which must be saved in the <em>siren</em> folder and have a file type of <em>.ini</em> (INI File). The sample <em>siren_default.ini</em> or <em>siren_windows_default.ini</em> file will provide a useful guide as to the content.</p>
<p>There are three special strings which will be replaced in the Files properties variables:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><em>$USER$</em>&nbsp;will be replaced with the current userid</li>
<li><em>$YEAR$</em>&nbsp;will be replaced with the base year value</li>
<li><em>$dirn</em>&nbsp;will be replaced with the corresponding variable from the <em>[Parents]</em> Section</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Technologies appear in two forms in the Preferences file. They appear in the Preferences Sections as words starting with an uppercase letter and separated by spaces (e.g <em>Fixed PV</em> with the Section name <em>[Fixed PV]</em>). In the Section Properties the technology names are changed to all lower case and spaces are replaced by underscores. Thus, <em>Fixed PV</em> will appear as <em>fixed_pv</em>. The lower case versions occur in the <em>[Colors]</em> Section and <em>[Grid] dispatchable</em>, <em>[Power] fossil_technologies</em>, and <em>[Power] technologies</em> variables.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Using the Simulation</h2>
<p>The simulation has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using SIREN to build scenarios for an energy mix as described in more detail below</li>
<li>Using the Powermatch data produced to complete a costed renewable energy scenario. This is described in <a href="#powermatch">Powermatch</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The simulation allows you to build scenarios for the energy mix for your area of interest. It is based around the map of your chosen area and allows you to visualise the layout of the existing electricity network plus the additional stations you place on the map to build your scenario(s). The map initially shows the main skeleton of the existing electricity grid infrastructure and current generation stations.</p>
<p>To add a new station simply right-click on the map at the desired location and then update the details for the station (Name, Technology, Capacity and so forth) and press <em>Save &amp; Exit</em>. You can also copy an existing station and other options as specified above. </p>
<p>As you build your scenario, the simulation adds additional infrastructure to connect the new generation plants to the grid. The colours for the majority of the items on the map are as you specify in the Preferences file. You navigate around the map using normal mouse movements to scroll, zoom, etc. and interact with it as described previously (<a href="#menus">Menus</a>). Using the various menu options you can model your whole scenario, or by right-clicking you can deal with an individual station. There are a number of additional windows, such as menu options, that can be opened to assist with using SIREN (see <a href="#windows">Windows</a>)</p>
<p>You can save multiple scenarios and add them and remove them as you wish. When you exit the simulation normally or <em>Save</em> scenarios (Ctrl+S) any modified scenarios will be saved. When you add new stations to your model they will be added as a new scenario which includes the date and time in its name, for example, Scenario_2015-06-09_1000. You can save all open scenarios as a single new scenario by using the <em>Save As...</em> option.</p>
<p>The strength of the simulation is in running the SAM Power Models (e.g. Ctrl+P). This will run the appropriate SAM model for each station you have chosen or for all renewable stations in your current simulation. SAM calculates a list of power outputs for each hour of the year (8,760 points). If the <em>show_menu</em> property is True you will be presented with a menu to specify what processing and charts to produce (see <a href="#popts">Power Model Options</a> below). If you choose to run the Financial Models or Powermatch you will be presented with an additional menu of options.</p>
<ul>
<li>The various charting features allow you to visualise the renewable energy output and how it compares to demand</li>
<li>The Financial Models option will invoke SAM Annual Output and Utility IPP/Commercial PPA Finance models. These enable a LCOE to be determined for the scenario</li>
<li>Powermatch allows you to complete a costed renewable energy scenario. It will use dispatchable generation to meet shortfalls in the renewable energy generation mix to match generation with demand (load) to quantify and cost dispatchable energy generation, storage and CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2011;e emissions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To simplify the inputs required to run the SAM Power Models SIREN uses variable files for most of the input variables as described in <a href="#sam">SAM Models used by SIREN</a>. You can change the default inputs by editing or creating your own copy of the variable files. With the One variable you may want to adjust is the hub height in the <em>windpower</em> model</li>
<li>If you run a simulation and get generation of 0 for a station it may be because SAM has returned an error; the error message will appear in the Status Window. If you don't normally have the Status Window open you can Open the window via the SIREN Windows sub-menu and rerun the Power models to find the error</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Notes on Wind Stations</h4>
<p>With increasing hub heights associated with larger turbines the SAM models are impacted by the lack of suitable wind speed data at greater heights. The MERRA-2 climate data has a maximum wind speed height of 50 metres which will cope with hub heights up to 85 metres (above that height the SAM <em>windpower</em> model will fail with an error - &ldquo;<em>... the closest wind speed measurement height (50 m) found is more than 35 m from the hub height specified</em>&rdquo;). To overcome the wind data limitation SIREN can extrapolate wind speeds to greater heights. To enable this you can use the <em>hub_formula</em> property of the <a href="#p_wind">[Wind]</a> and <a href="#p_offw">[Offshore Wind]</a> Sections of the Preferences file (behaviour can also be changed with the <em>hub_spread</em> property). This formula can be used to calculate a hub height (for rotor lengths greater than 85) and to extrapolate wind speed using either of two commonly used laws (models). The law to be used can be specified in the <em>extrapolate</em> property of the appropriate wind Section(s) and can be either <em>logarithmic</em>, the default, or <em>Hellmann</em>. This additional data will be added to the normal wind file and passed to the SAM windpower model. If you wish to use this you need update the <em>windpower</em> variables file to allow the default hub height (85 m) to be overridden.</p>
<p>From &lsquo;Do we really need rotor equivalent wind speed?&rsquo; (Van Sark etal, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.2319#:~:text=For%20situations%20where%20the%20ratio,and%20the%20wind%20speed%20at" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.2319#:~:text=For%20situations%20where%20the%20ratio,and%20the%20wind%20speed%20at</a>) a possible formula for calculating hub height is - <code>H = 0.789 D + 14.9 m</code>. For the <em>hub_formula</em> property this can be set as:</p>
<p><code>hub_formula=int(floor((0.789 * rotor + 14.9) / 5) * 5)</code></p>
<p>SIREN will replace <code>rotor</code> with the rotor diameter for the station turbine and perform the calculation which will round the calculated hub height down to the nearest 5 metres. You can of course just set <code>hub_formula=90</code> to set a fixed height</p>
<p>Discussions on the two wind profile laws can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_profile_power_law" target="_blank">Wind profile power law</a> (aka Hellmann law) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_wind_profile" target="_blank">Log wind profile</a> (aka logarithmic law). The Hellmann law tends to give slightly higher wind speeds. &lsquo;Methodologies Used in the Extrapolation of Wind Speed Data at Different Heights and Its Impact in the Wind Energy Resource Assessment in a Region&rsquo; (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221912731_Methodologies_Used_in_the_Extrapolation_of_Wind_Speed_Data_at_Different_Heights_and_Its_Impact_in_the_Wind_Energy_Resource_Assessment_in_a_Region" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221912731_Methodologies_Used_in_the_Extrapolation_of_Wind_Speed_Data_at_Different_Heights_and_Its_Impact_in_the_Wind_Energy_Resource_Assessment_in_a_Region</a>) provides a fuller discussion on the topic.</p>

<li><em>Power - Shortfall analysis</em> option produces a table and line charts that attempt to assist with analysing shortfalls on a daily basis. The analysis iterations option will produce average shortfalls for that number of days, for example, 3 iterations will produce average shortfall figures for one, two and three days. The figures are calculated by &ldquo;averaging&rdquo; the generation shortfall over the chosen number of days. This option will also produce cumulative shortfall charts that add the average hourly shortfall to generation to attempt to flatten out the shortfall over the year</li>

<p><strong><u>Plot Navigation</u></strong></p>
<p>The tool used to produce the charts, matplotlib, has a navigation toolbar
(<a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html" target="_blank">Interactive navigation</a>) to enable you to navigate and manipulate the chart (but doesn't allow you to change the chart data). It includes options to zoom into an area of the chart and to save the chart image (by default to the <em>scenarios</em> folder).
By default the size of charts produced is determined by matplotlib, or by the <em>Maximise Plot windows</em> option (above). By using the <em>orientation</em>, <em>papersize</em>, and <em>save_format</em> Properties of the <em>[Power]</em> section it is possible to produce the charts in a number of formats, such as PDF format, and in a specific page size and layout. If you use these options you can save charts in a standardised format (these Properties can be added and removed by using the <em>Preferences -> Edit Section</em> menu option).</p>
<p>For most charts the Pan/Zoom option (<img src="pan_zoom.png" alt="Pan/Zoom">) enables you to zoom in on the chart using the right mouse button and to pan across the chart using the left mouse button.</p>
<p>For the two hourly charts (<em>Power by hour</em> and <em>Power by hour - augmented</em>) and charts produced by Powerplot there is a modified pan and zoom feature to enhance visual examination of the chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out on the time (x) axis. The position of the mouse within the chart determines where the zoom will centre upon (that is, that point will remain fixed and the rest of the chart will move away from or towards that point)</li>
<li>Moving the mouse while holding down the left button will allow you to pan across the chart</li>
<li>Clicking the right mouse button or pressing the <em>r</em> key will reset the chart to the original state. This will allow you to zoom out to the original state and then zoom in to another period on the chart</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>f</em> key will expand the chart window to fullscreen. Pressing it again will return it to the previous size</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>l</em> key will allow you to move the legend, although the behaviour may be a little erratic. Initially, the legend will be moved to the top right of the window and be arranged as a vertical list. By clicking the left mouse button within the legend and dragging the mouse you can move it to a different location. In the process it may cause the chart to also move or cause some odd behaviour with it. In these cases pressing the <em>r</em> key will reset the chart</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>m</em> key will display a monthly chart. Each press will show the next month. You can also navigate to a chosen month by pressing the number for the month after the <em>m</em>. For example, pressing <em>m10</em> will display October</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>w</em> key will display a weekly chart. Each press will show the next week. If the <em>m</em> key has been pressed the weeks for that month will be displayed</li>
<li>Pressing <em>PageUp</em> or <em>PageDown</em> will display the previous or next week or month</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>left</em> or <em>right</em> arrow will scroll the display to the left or right</li>
<li>Pressing the <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> arrow will scroll the display up or down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For cumulative (stacked) charts produced by Powerplot this feature may perform slowly so please be a little patient</p>
<h4 id="powerplot"><u>Powerplot</u></h4>
<p><code>powerplot</code> is a standalone program that will produce either hourly, half-hourly or diurnal charts from a spreadsheet that conforms to certain constraints. It is intended to be used to chart (detailed) results either from Powermatch or some of the files produced by SIREN's Powermodel.
<div class="experiment">
The program can also be used to either:
<ul>
<li>determine the strength of the linear relationship, or linear correlation, between a target column, for example Load, and other columns within the input spreadsheet, or</li>
<li>determine the percentage contribution of chosen columns in meeting the target</li>
</ul>
The correlation or contribution can be for the full year or a chosen period or range of months.
</div>
<p>The spreadsheet must have:</p>
<ol>
<li>A header row that defines the content of the underlying rows (this need not be the first row)</li>
<li>The first (header) column should be <em>Hour</em> for hourly data or <em>Interval</em> for half-hourly data, and the second should be <em>Period</em> with a cell format of <em>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm</em>. The program uses the year in the first period row to determine if the data is for a leap year</li>
<li>The rows immediately following the header row should contain data for each hour or half-hour of the year (either 8,760 or 17,520 for a normal year and 8,784 or 17,568 for a leap; or a smaller number for an incomplete year)</li>
</ol>
The program displays a window of options. The default values are specified in the <a href="#p_pp">[Powerplot]</a> Section of the Preferences file. It is possible to have a number of entries for files (<em>file_choices</em>) listed in recent order (<em>file_history</em>).
<table border="0" class="none">
<tr><td class="top" style="width: 20%;"><dfn>Recent Files</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A pull-down list of recent spreadsheets. Click on the desired spreadsheet to choose a different one from the list. The list will be ordered in terms of most recently accessed first (<em>file_history</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>File</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Click on this field to choose the desired spreadsheet (<em>file</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Sheet</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A pull-down list to enable you to choose the desired worksheet (<em>sheet</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Period(s)</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A pull-down list for a full year, a month or other defined seasons or periods that may be defined in the Preferences file. If an option other than <em>&lt;None&gt;</em> is chosen the resulting chart will present an average diurnal chart for the chosen period (<em>period</em>). If the first period is a month a second pull-down list allows you to choose an ending month range. This can either be a later month in the year or, if earlier than the first value, months will wrap to the start of the year. For example, Period 1 of Nov and Period 2 of Feb will correlate Nov, Dec, Jan and Feb (<em>period2</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Target</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A pull-down list of column names. If the chart is intended to show how the chosen columns meet a target column, typically Load, this enables you to choose that column. Choosing <em>&lt;None&gt;</em> means no target field. If a target field is chosen the chart will show excess generation as lightly shaded areas above the target values (<em>target</em>)
<div class="experiment">A target is required for Contribution and Correlation</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Overlay</dfn></td>
<td class="none">This option allows an overlay on the chart. It presents a pull-down list of options:
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;none&gt;</em></li>
<li><em>Charge</em> The total of energy used to recharge storage to be shown as an overlay on the chart; it provides an indication of how and when excess energy has been used for recharge. If a Target, e.g. Load, is chosen the target values will be added to the figure to indicate the use of excess energy above the target.</li>
<li><em>Underlying load</em> If available underlying load will be displayed on the chart. Underlying load include the additional load met by Rooftop PV (DPV) rather than utility generation</li>
</ul>
</tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Title</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Specify a title for the chart. There are two special strings which will be replaced in the title:
<ul>
<li><em>$YEAR$</em> will be replaced with the year (first Period value)</li>
<li><em>$MTH$</em> or <em>$MONTH$</em> will be replaced with the chosen Period</li>
</ul>
If it's not a diurnal chart (i.e. Period is <em>&lt;None&gt;</em>) any occurence of &rsquo;Diurnal&lsquo; in the title wil be removed (<em>title</em>)
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Maximum</dfn></td>
<td class="none">You can specify a maximum value for the Power (y) axis. This allows you to produce a series of charts with the same scale (<em>maximum</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Type of Plot</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The type of chart to be produced. Options are <em>Bar Chart</em>, <em>Cumulative</em>, <em>Heat Map</em>, <em>Line Chart</em> and <em>Step Chart</em>. <em>Bar Chart</em>, <em>Cumulative</em> and <em>Step Chart</em> produce cumulative (stacked) charts and have filled areas by technology (or Columns). A Step Chart is similar to a Bar Chart but does not have spaces between the hourly bars; also it is a lot faster to display than a Bar Chart (a Bar Chart is not recommended for hourly charts). If a Target field (e.g. Load) is chosen the area above the Target value (i.e. excess generation) in the Cumulative and Step chart have a lightly shaded value (the degree of shading is chosen by the <em>alpha</em> property in the [Powerplot] Section of the Preferences file). A Heat Map visualises the total value of chosen columns to indicate the highest through lowest values of the range or, if a target column is chosen, an indication of how the total value meets the target value. Each &ldquo;square&rdquo; or &ldquo;cell&rdquo; of the map represents an hour; the vertical axis is hours in a day and the horizontal axis is days for the chosen period (<em>plot</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Percentage</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Checking this option will produce a percentage (stacked) curve. The chart will have filled areas showing the percentage of generation for each technology. It is recommended to not set a Target field (i.e. set it to <em>&lt;None&gt;</em>) as this will merely remove the Target field (and it's data) from the chart (<em>percentage</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Spill label</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Use this to set a suffix for Legend entries for spilled energy. If the field is blank no spilled energy labels will appear in the Legend (<em>spill_label</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Show Grid</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The gridlines to be included on the chart. Options are <em>Both</em>, <em>Horizontal</em>, <em>Vertical</em> and <em>None</em>. The default is <em>None</em> (<em>grid</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><div class="experiment"><dfn>Breakdowns</dfn></div></td>
<td class="none"><div class="experiment">A TML Details worksheet breaks down RE generation into a number of categories. This option allows you to choose which categories to chart. You select those you wish to chart and drag them to the left hand column. To produce a chart that shows generation to meet load, charging of storage, and surplus you should drag <em>TML</em> and <em>Surplus</em> to the left hand column and drag <em>Charge &lt;battery&gt;</em> columns to the left hand Column Order above any other items. In producing the chart the first breakdown will have the normal colour for the technology while the others will have a translucent colour and possibly a pattern. This allows the breakdowns to be related by colour and yet distinguished by translucency. An example of options for plotting TML details might look something like this:
<p>
<img src="plot_tml.png" alt="TML Plot">

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you create a TML Detail spreadsheet you need to open the spreadsheet and save it before it can be used.</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Column Order</dfn></td>
<td class="none">To produce the chart you select those columns to be included. This field consists of two tables (lists) of columns. Those in the left hand list will be included in the chart while those on the right will be excluded. The included columns will be charted in the chosen order. You can drag individual or a number of columns between the two lists to get the desired configuration. The chart colour for the column will be displayed as the background color for the column (<em>columns</em>)
<div class="experiment">Contribution or Correlation will be performed between the target and each of the chosen columns</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="bottom"><strong>Done, Plot, Colours, Co..., Help</strong></td>
<td class="none">At the bottom of the window are a number of buttons:
<ul>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> option will save generation in MWh for each chosen station for each hour of the year (8,760 hours) as calculated by SAM. This can be used in detailed analysis or as an option to avoid having to reprocess the station in the future, by updating a Station's </em>Power File</em> field. The default filename can be set using the <em>data_file</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file; otherwise it will in the format of <em>Power_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm...</em></li>
<li><em>Save (adjusted) Hourly Data Output by Station</em> option will save generation in MWh for each station and other options for each hour of the year (8,760 hours). This is the hourly output calculated by the SAM model multiplied by any adjustments. If appropriate Power Model options are chosen data for Generation, Excess, Load and Storage will also be saved. The default filename can be set using the <em>data_file</em> property of the [Files] Section of the Preferences file; otherwise it will in the format of <em>Power_Detail_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm...</em></li>
<li><em>Save (adjusted) Hourly Data Output by Technology</em> option will save generation in MWh for each technology and other options for each hour of the year (8,760 hours). This is the hourly output calculated by the SAM model multiplied by any adjustments. If appropriate Power Model options are chosen data for Generation, Excess, Load and Storage will also be saved. The default filename can be set using the <em>data_file</em> property of the [Files] Section of the Preferences file; otherwise it will in the format of <em>Power_Detail_Technology_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm...</em></li>
<li><em>Save Powermatch data</em> option will save save the input data for Powermatch (or Powerbalance). There are two possible output formats:
<ol>
<li>Powermatch uses scenario worksheets. If the <em>pm_template</em> property of the <em>[Files]</em> Section is set, SIREN will save the inputs in this format. The file can (only) be saved as an <em>.xlsx</em> format file</li>
<li>The original Powerbalance uses the hourly shortfalls and overall generation figures in its computations. This option saves this data in a spreadsheet to simplify copying it into a Powerbalance workbook. The cells required for Powerbalance are highlighted in colour. The worksheet contains the generation summary data followed by the shortfall data. The file can be saved as <em>.csv</em> for a CSV file or <em>.xls</em> for an Excel file</li>
</ol>
<li><em>Show Summary/Other Tables</em> option will cause various tables to be presented:
<ul>
<li>A brief summary table of Capacity and Output for each selected station. The default filename will in the format of <em>powermodel_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>
<li>If Storage values are specified a storage table is produced showing hourly figures for Load, Generation, Storage Used, Storage Losses (determined by Discharge and Recharge loss percentages), Storage Balance, Shortfall and Excess. Shortfall indicates the shortfall against Load (Load less Generation, Storage Used and Losses); Excess indicates excess generation that could not be stored due to either the Storage Capacity limit or Recharge cap. The default filename will in the format of <em>Storage_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>
<li><em>Generation Summary</em> table is a brief summary of the overall generation for the current execution of the Power model. The figures are summations of the 8,760 hourly figures. Some comments on the table:
<ul>
<li>The Multiplier column indicates any multipliers from the adjust generation option (plus load if load is grown)</li>
<li>The Row column is merely a technique to display the rows in a suitable order</li>
<li>The initial rows are the totals for each of the technologies, followed by the total of all generation and the load to be met</li>
<li><em>Gen. - Load</em> is a raw indicator of generation versus load but ignoring any timing issues. A negative value indicates a shortfall in overall generation while a positive value indicates excess overall generation</li>
<li><em>Storage Capacity</em> is the amount of storage in this execution</li>
<li><em>Storage Used</em> is how much storage has been used to meet shortfall in generation for any period. This is that portion of renewable generation that has been stored and then reused</li>
<li><em>Excess Gen.</em> is energy generation that has been lost/dumped due to either full storage or constraints on storage recharge</li>
<li><em>Shortfall</em> is the lack of available energy (generation plus storage) to meet load</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>Power - Shortfall analysis</em> Plot option produces a table showing hourly figures for Load, Generation, Shortfall, and, optionally, grid losses. If iterations are chosen an additional table showing daily shortfalls for each iteration will also be produced. The default file(s) name will in the format of <em>Hourly Shortfall_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em> and <em>Daily Shortfall_Table_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm</em></li>

<h4>Notes on the Financial Model Table</h4>
<ul>

<p>Running the SIREN models will produce hourly generation figures which identify generation shortfalls and excesses against load (demand). One of the outputs from SIREN is a table of these generation shortfalls which could be met by storage (charged by surplus renewable generation) and dispatchable energy generation. The Powermatch (<code>powermatch</code>) component of SIREN can be used to match generation with demand (load) to quantify and cost this dispatchable energy generation, storage and CO<sub>2</sub>-e emissions. This enables you to complete a costed renewable energy scenario. If the input data spreadsheet has zones (of generation) the calculations will be performed for each zone.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Load.</strong>&nbsp;Load is a measure of demand on the electicity network. It can be grouped into two broad areas:
<ul>
<li>Operational Load, or simply Load, is the demand needed to be met by the (utility-scale) generators and storage on the network. This is the load that <code>Powermatch</code> meets using the proposed generators</li>
<li>Underlying Load is Operational Load <u>plus</u> additional demand that is met by &ldquo;behind the meter&rdquo; generation such as Rooftop PV. <code>Powermatch</code> adds this generation both to generation by the network and generation to meet load. Thus, these generators have no shortfall or surplus. At present <stong>Batch</strong> doesn't handle Underlying load
<br />Identification of underlying generation is via the <em>underlying</em> property of the <em>[Powermatch]</em> Section of the Preferences file. It is also possible to indicate a specific generator is operational rather than underlying via the <em>operational</em> property</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the outputs from Powermatch is calculated Levelised Cost figures for each Generator, LCOG, and Storage, LCOS, and an overall LCOE. The Levelised Costs are calculated based upon either Capital (Capex), Operations (Opex) and fuel costs or a Reference LCOE and Reference Capacity Factor (CF) for the generator or storage.
Be aware that if a facility is not used it will have no costs associated with it (this is based upon the premise that the facility would not be included in any detailed modelling).
Powermatch has three interpretations of levelised cost:
<ol>
<li>LCOG and LCOS. This is the average cost of all generation (or, in the case of storage, discharge) produced by a facility</li>
<li>LCOE. The average cost of electricity. This is generally higher as it excludes surplus - spilled or curtailed - generation from renewable technologies not used &ldquo;to meet load&rdquo;. This is the default, and recommended, figure for levelised cost (excluding carbon cost; <em>adjusted_lcoe</em>). You can choose to ignore this in calculating the LCOE. For non-renewable technologies this is the same as LCOG</li>
<li>LCOE with CO2 Cost. The average cost of electricity (LCOE) including carbon cost</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The SIREN Powermatch component was in part inspired by the Powerbalance worksheets developed by Ben Rose. For those who would prefer his spreadsheet approach an enhanced version, Powerbalance2, is available at <a href="https://cleanenergymodelling.com.au/powerbalance2/" target="_blank">https://cleanenergymodelling.com.au/powerbalance2/</a></p>
<h4>Powermatch input (data) file formats</h4>
<p>Powermatch has a number of input files which are generally in the form of a simple table stored in either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file. Constraints, Generators and Optimisation tables can be stored as separate worksheets in the same Excel file (workbook). Further details on some of the file formats can be found below. The input files are:
<table border="0", class="none" style="margin-left:35px">
<tr class="none">
<td class="none"><dfn>Constraints</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A table of constraints on the performance of a generator, for example, the maximum discharge rate for a battery or the minimum capacity for a generator once it is turned on (lower operating limit). The columns in the table are described below. Each row contains details for a constraint</td>
</tr>

<td class="none"><dfn>Generators</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A table of generators and storage facilities providing details on costs, emissions, operating lifetime, and a pointer to the constraints on the facility.

</li>
<li><strong>Detail</strong>. Invoke Powermatch to produce a detailed spreadsheet of the Powermatch outputs. It provides detail on how demand was met for each hour of the year. If <em>save_tables</em> is set generators and constraints will be saved to spreadsheet. This option also produces a Summary worksheet as described above. This Detail worksheet allows for more detailed analysis on how each facility is utilised, for example, by using spreadsheet formulae:-
<ul>
<li>Assuming a generator is listed in column L.<br />Calculate the percentage of time it is running below 55% of capacity - <code>=COUNTIF(L2:L8771,">"&L1*0.55)/8760</code></li>
<li>Assuming a storage facility is listed in column I, it's balance will be in column J.<br />Calculate the percentage of time it is at full capacity - <code>=COUNTIF(J2:J8771,"="&I1)/8760</code><br />and at less than or equal to 10% capacity - <code>=COUNTIF(J2:J8771,"<="&I1*0.1)/8760</code></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Batch</strong>. Invoke Powermatch for a number of &ldquo;models&rdquo; with different capacities for each technology.

<br />
<dfn>Capacity (MW)</dfn> is required and must be the first entry. The other Report Groups can be <strong>in any order</strong>. <dfn>Carbon Price</dfn> allows you to input a different Carbon Price for each Model. <dfn>Discount Rate</dfn> allows you to input a different discount rate for each Model. If Carbon Price and/or Discount Rate are to be included they must appear immediately below the Total row for the Capacity inputs.
<br />By default the resulting output will be appended as a new worksheet to the input file. You can create a new spreadsheet by setting the <em>batch_new_file</em> property to True
<br />It is also possible to perform batch runs on zone data, but if so both the input data file and the batch file must have input capacities by zone. In this case the name for each facility identifies both the zone and technology in the form <em>zone.technology</em>.
<br />The Batch option also has a prototype chart facility that can be used to do sensitivity analysis on a suite of batch models - see <a href="#pm_batch_charts">below</a>
<br /><strong>Usage notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you want to include a Total row in the outputs you need to have a Total row (as the last row) in the <em>Capacity (MW)</em> Report Group</li>
<li><strong>Beware:</strong> If the batch input worksheet (capacity figures) contains formulae you need to be careful doing multiple batch executions. You may need to open the batch worksheet and save it before doing another batch execution.</li>
<li>(in case you missed it). If you're modelling with zones both the input data file and the batch file must have input capacities by zone</li>
<li>(At present) The same Load data is used for all models in a Batch execution</li>
<li>At present Batch doesn't handle Underlying load</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Optimise</strong>. Invoke the Optimise function. This will use an iterative approach to optimise the input generator capacities to produce a solution with (a) either a lower overall LCOE, (b) the lowest weight for six variables, or (c) both. It will complete by displaying a chart of how the value for LCOE has converged to a minimum, and either (if <em>optimise_multitable</em> and <em>more_details</em> are set) a three dimensional plot showing the three variables with the highest weightings or (if <em>optimise_multitable</em> is set) a table of all variables for the multi-variable approach. Depending on which options are specified you will be presented with a number of &ldquo;best picks&rdquo; where you can choose your preferred choice. This will then produce a summary table which will also contain details on the Optimisation parameters used. It will also update the adjustment values for each generator to enable you to produce a Powermatch spreadsheet. If you choose a solution this can be added to a batch input file (if <em>optimise_to_batch</em> is set).
<ul>
<li>If you are using generator adjustments it may be useful to invoke <strong>Summary</strong> to set or reset the starting capacities for the optimsation (using <strong>Reset</strong> to set initial values or <strong>Restore</strong> to restore previously saved values)</li>
<li>If you optimise with zones you want to ensure <em>optimise_default</em> is defined to ensure optimisation entries are created for each <em>zone.technology</em> combination. You can then update these entries to the desired range and step increment and save them to a new optimisation spreadsheet if required</li>
<li>If you use the option to add to a batch file the initial batch spreadsheet should include a single column including the groups you wish to have in the batch report. The column should begin with the following rows:
<table border="0" class="none" style="margin-left:35px">
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>&lt;Header rows&gt;<dfn></td><td class="none">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Model Label<dfn></td><td class="none">Row for Model label or name</td></tr>

<li><strong>TML Detail</strong>. The detailed <strong>Detail</strong> spreadsheet produced by Powermatch contains generation figures for each RE technology but not how that generation has contributed &ldquo;to meet load&rdquo; and charge storage.

<p>The Constraints, Generators and Optimisation tables can be edited, updated and saved and the revised table(s) used as inputs for the <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>Powermatch</strong>, <strong>Batch</strong> and <strong>Optimise</strong> options. During the edit process the revised values can be exported as a new spreadsheet. If the table(s) is saved but not exported the revised values will not be available once Powermatch is exited. You can also choose another sheet, however, if the sheet you choose is not the correct format you may get unusual behaviour.</p>
<h4>Generators</h4>
<p>To address the shortfall in generation encountered by a renewable scenario other dispatchable generation and storage facilities can be used. These are defined in a Generators table. The Generators table is also used to define the Reference <em>LCOE</em> and <em>LCOE CF</em> figures for Renewable technologies. The dispatchable facilities are dispatched after renewable generators. The fields are:

<p>Powermatch will calculate costs in either of two ways, either by using a Reference LCOE and CF (<em>(l)</em> fields) or by using input costs (<em>(c)</em> fields) . If Capex is present it will use input costs otherwise it will use Reference LCOE. The option is chosen for each facility<em>(*)</em> fields are required for either method.</p>
<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>Utilisation of each dispatchable generator and storage facility can be constrained by Powermatch in a number of ways. All figures are expressed as a percentage. In the tables the values will be displayed as a decimal fraction (0.00 to 1.00). All figures are hourly except for Parasitic Loss which is daily. The approach Powermatch uses is rather simplistic in that any losses need to cater for any loss of efficiency in storing energy or retrieving energy. The constraints are:

<h4 id="pm_batch_charts">Batch charts</h4>
<p>With the Batch option there is a possibility to produce a set of charts (graphs) to display impacts of a range of models. The functionality is somewhat limited and should be considered as useful for creating protoype charts rather than fully formatted ones. The specifications for charts can be included in the input worksheet after the desired report details. Charts are created in a worksheet placed after the results worksheet. Charts are specified by a number of rows of information in the first three columns of the input worksheet. The first column is the chart parameter, the second contains the report group as in the report outputs, the third contains the row (e.g. technology) of interest. These are the chart parameters:

<div class="experiment">
<h4>Optimise and Optimisation</h4>
<p>In an attempt to simplify the process of determining the optimal generation mix, Powermatch has an optimisation function. This function can assist in providing a starting point for determining the optimal mix rather than the optimal mix itself. The function uses a genetic algorithm to identify three possible optimal solutions:
<ol>
<li>A solution with the lowest LCOE for the input renewable and dispatchable technologies</li>
<li>A solution with the best (lowest) weighting for six variables - lowest LCOE, lowest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, lowest Overall Cost, lowest surplus generation, highest RE percentage and maximising the percentage of load met</li>
<li>A solution with the lowest LCOE and weighting for six variables. Running both does use a single population and so there is some &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; between them which may distort the result</li>
</ol>
If a carbon cost is included the LCOE with CO2 Cost is used for evaluation of the lowest LCOE
<p>
Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and simulate evolution of multiple generations that evolve to produce an optimal solution, in this case 1. lowest LCOE 2. lowest weighted solution, or 3. lowest in both (<strong>Note:</strong> This is a different approach to optimisation than in Power Model). The approach has a number of inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chromosome. This is a series of &ldquo;switches&rdquo; with each switch representing whether a unit of technology is or is not to be included in this iteration of Powermatch. The format of the chromosome is defined by the Optimisation table. In creating the chromosome each technology will be assigned a number of switches representing either a discrete unit of technology or a proportion of the total capacity for that technology (as defined by the Optimisation entry)</li>
<li>The remaining inputs options are as set out here. The options are specified in the <a href="#p_pm">[Powermatch]</a> Section of the Preferences file. The associated property is indicated in brackets at the end of the description.</p>
<table border="0" class="none" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td class="top" style="width: 15%;"><dfn>Adjust Load</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Adjust the load. You can specify a multiplier for Load, between 0 and the cap set by the <em>adjust_cap</em> property in the <a href="#power">[Power]</a> Section of the Preferences file; the default is 25. This variable is not saved</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Population size</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Size of population. Each member of the population has a chromsome made up of switches that are randomly on or off. The greater the population size the greater the chance that the initial state of the population will contain a chromosome representing the optimal solution, but the longer the optimisation process will take (<em>optimise_population</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Number of iterations</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Number of iterations (generations; not to be confused with (electrical) generation). For each iteration a competition is held between (each of two) members to identify which has the preferred characteristics, in this case lowest LCOE and/or weight. The winners are then used to create the population for the next iteration. The greater the number of iterations the better chance the solutions will converge to an optimum value, but the longer the optimisation process will take (<em>optimise_iterations</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Mutation probability</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A probability of mutation. This is a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population to the next. The solution may change entirely from the previous solution and come to a better solution. This probability should be set low. If it is set too high, the search will turn into a primitive random search.(<em>optimise_mutation)</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Exit if stable</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A stop option. To reduce the number of iterations it is possible to terminate the optimisation if there appears to be no change to the solution after a specified number of iterations. The downside is that the optimisation may not have evolved on the correct path (i.e. moved towards a local minimum rather than true minimum) (<em>optimise_stop</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Optimisation choice</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A choice as whether to run the lowest LCOE option, the multi-variable option, or both options together. Running both does use a single population and so there is some &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; between them which may distort the result (<em>optimise_choice</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Multi-variable inputs</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Some values for each of the six optimisation variables for the multi-variable solution:
<ol>
<li>The Weight, a value between 0 and 1, to be applied to this variable</li>
<li>The best target value (Better). A value less than zero indicates the maximum or minimum value. For percentage targets it can be between 0 (i.e 0%) and 1 (i.e 100%). If Better is (positive and) less than Worse we want the lowest value; if Better is greater than Worse we want the highest value</li>
<li>The worst target value (Worse). A value less than zero indicates the maximum or minimum value</li>
</ol>
If the best and worse values are the same for a variable and that value is not achieved the variable will be given zero weight for that iteration. As such, it may be helpful to provide even a small difference between the best and worse values to provide some differentiation between solutions</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>LCOE</dfn></td>
<td class="none">A lower value is better (<em>optimise_lcoe</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Load%</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The percentage of Load met. A higher value, up to 100%, is better (<em>optimise_load_pct</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Surplus %</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The percentage of surplus generation. A lower value is better (<em>optimise_surplus_pct</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>RE%</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The percentage of generation from renewables. A higher value is better (<em>optimise_re_pct</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>Cost</dfn></td>
<td class="none">Overall cost. A lower value is better. This may just be a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; for LCOE (<em>optimise_cost</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lr"><dfn>CO2</dfn></td>
<td class="none">The estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. A lower value is better (<em>optimise_co2</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bottom"><strong>Quit, Proceed</strong></td>
<td class="none">Either quit or proceed with the optimisation</td></tr>
</table>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes on multi-variable inputs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is some &ldquo;overlap&rdquo; between the six variables, for example, LCOE and (overall) Cost</li>
<li>In most cases, optimisation will be attempting to meet the load profile. The suggestion is to give Load % the highest weighting, and to choose a range for Load % between 1 and 0.98. &ldquo;Unusual&rdquo; outcomes can occur if the load percentage achieved is very low</li>
<li>If you choose the optimisation choice of Both there is interaction between both results</li>
</ul>
<p>The Powermatch optimisation approach uses the Optimisation table to define the range of possible values for each of the renewable technologies and dispatchable and storage facilities. Entries are required for all Renewable technologies and dispatchable and storage facilities. The fields are:
<table border="0" class="none" style="margin-left:35px" >
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Name</dfn></td><td class="none">Name of the Technology (matches either RE or generator)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Approach</dfn></td><td class="none">Approach for how this generator will be treated. There are two options:
<ul>
<li>Discrete. A list of discrete Capacities representing individual generation units (facilties) for the technology, e.g. individual generators</li>
<li>Range. The (total) Capacity for the technology is divided into a number of equal steps. A minimum capacity can also be defined</li>
<ul></td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Capacities</dfn></td><td class="none">The capacities for a Discrete generator. This is a series of numbers separated by spaces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Capacity Max</dfn></td><td class="none">The maximum (total) capacity for a Range</td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Capacity Min</dfn></td><td class="none">The minimum capacity for a Range</td></tr>
<tr><td class="none"><dfn>Capacity Step</dfn></td><td class="none">The size of each capacity step for a Range</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The capacity fields can be a single field, <dfn>Values</dfn>, as a string of numbers separated by spaces. For Discrete this will be a string of capacities and for Range it will be three Capacity numbers - Min, Max and Step. If <em>optimise_default</em> is set this can be used to set optimisation table entries for missing facilities. The default entry can have two or three options separated by commas, as follows:
<ul>
<li>Two entries: minimum capacity is zero; the first entry is maximum capacity; the second entry is the number of steps</li>
<li>Three entries: match the same as Range - minimum capacity, maximum capacity, step capacity</li>
<li>Entry ends with <em>d</em>: the entry is multiplied by the default capacity for the facility</li>
<li>Entry ends with <em>c</em>: the entry is multiplied by the adjusted capacity (capacity x multiplier)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Powermatch optimisation approach is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Generate a chromosome as defined by the Optimisation table</li>
<li>Create an initial population, each member with a random copy of the chromosome</li>
<li>Calculate fitness of population. Select either (1.) lowest LCOE that meets 100% of load (demand), (2.) lowest weighting, or (3.) the lowest of both. For each member:
<ol>
<li>Using their chromosome and the Optimisation table determine the capacity for each technology</li>
<li>Run Powermatch with this generation mix to calculate (1.) the LCOE (score) and (2.) the weighting</li>
</ol>
<li>For each iteration</li>
<ol>
<li>Select the best parents by competition</li>
<li>Breed new population by random crossover of chromosomes for winners</li>
<li>Randomly mutate the population</li>
<li>Calculate fitness of population. Select either (1.) lowest LCOE that meets 100% of load (demand), (2.) lowest weighting, or (3.) lowest of both</li>
<li>Exit loop if LCOE has remained the same for the specified number of iterations</li>
<li>Include either (1.) lowest LCOE, (2.) lowest weighting or (3.) lowest of both in the next iteration
</ol>
<li>Produce
<ol>
<li>A chart showing the progression of LCOE over each iteration</li>
<li>A three dimensional plot showing the best individual for each iteration. The three variables with the highest weighting are chosen for the plot. It is also possible to pick one of the solutions by clicking the mouse on that point - a small box showing the values for each of the three variables will be displayed. You can &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; the plot around by holding down the left mouse button and then moving the mouse (<em>optimise_multiplot</em>; default is True)</li>
<li>Optionally, a table showing the best individual for each iteration. You can also choose an individual by clicking anywhere on the desired row. On entry the top row of the table will have the lowest weight and will be chosen on exit (<em>optimise_multitable</em>; default is False)</li>
</ol>
<li>Optionally, produce tables for best candidate (1.) with lowest LCOE and (2.) lowest weighting if the <em>more_details</em> property is set to True</li>
<li>Optionally, present a table for the optimal solutions (<em>optimise_multitable</em>; default is False). The table shows the adjustment values and capacity for each generator followed by the estimated value for each of the six multi-variables prioritised by Weight. By pressing the appropriate button the adjustment values for the chosen solution will be made available for <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>Powermatch</strong></li>

<h4>Minimal Preferences file for Powermatch</h4>
<p>It is possible to run <code>powermatch</code> with a minimal Preferences file. If you have a Powermatch data file produced from SIREN you can use that as an input to Powermatch without having access to the full set of SIREN files. As well as the <a href="#p_pm">[Powermatch]</a> Section of the Preferences file the only properties required are:
<ul>
<li>If you want to access the same folders:- [Base] <em>year</em>, [Parents] Section properties, [Files] <em>scenario_prefix</em> and <em>scenarios</em> properties</li>
<li>[Power] <em>adjust_cap</em> property if you want to use a different cap for Adjust Generators</li>
<li>[Windows] <em>log_status</em> property to turn off the Session log</li>
<li>[Windows] <em>restorewindows</em> property to turn remember the window layout of the Powermatch main window</li>
<li>If you want to use <code>powerplot</code> and have access to the same colours, periods, and seasons as the main Preferences file then you might also want the appropriate properties from the [Colors], [Power] and [Powerplot] Sections and the [Map] <em>map_choice</em> property</li>

<h4 id="pmtmldetail"><u>pmtmldetail</u></h4>
<p><code>pmtmldetail</code> is a small utility that will take a <code>powermatch</code> Detail worksheet and create a new worksheet that contains additional detail on the breakdown of generation for RE technology. The utility will breakdown hourly generation into four categories:
<ol>
<li>Generation. The original Generation figure as presented in the Detail worksheet</li>
<li>TML. How much generation was used to meet load</li>
<li>Charge. How much generation was used to recharge storage</li>
<li>Surplus. Surplus or spilled generation</li>
</ol>
<p>The utility adds an additional row, <em>Split</em>, at the top of the worksheet to indicate which category the RE generation relates to. No changes are made to non_RE generation.

<h3 id="dataview">Data View</h3>
<p>This experimental feature overlays a set of pie charts or bar charts on the SIREN map, either at individual station locations or based upon the grid of MERRA-2 &ldquo;weather&rdquo; cells. It can be used to visualise the contribution to overall generation from a group of stations. This could assist with identifying optimal placement of stations. For example, identifying potential Renewable Energy Zones could be assisted by running SAM models for identically sized stations placed within each of the cells. When the program is invoked it will display SIREN's coordinates grid. By default the grid is based on geographic coordinates but can be set to show the MERRA-2 cells by setting the <em>merra2_grid</em> property of the <a href="#p_view">[View]</a> Section of the Preferences file to <em>True</em>. The program can accept data in two formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>A table of latitudes and longitudes containing the generation in each location for a number of RE technologies, or</li>
<li>The summary table from a Powermodel execution from SIREN which contains a list of stations, their technology and generation. This format requires the stations in the list to be present in the Scenarios loaded into SIREN</li>
</ol>
<p>The program analyses the generation figures for each or all technologies and ovelays charts that show the relative generation for each station or weather cell compared to the maximum generation figure. In Bar Charts the bars are relative to the maximum generation for any technology while percentages are either relative to the total for the cell or for each technology. In Pie Charts the pie slices indicate the contribution of each technology and the total pie slices and percentages are relative to the maximum generation. The base size (scale) of the charts are the same size as the MERRA-2 cells.</p>

<h3 id="tricks">Performance and Execution Tricks</h3>
<p>Processing a simulation with a large number of stations can take a while to process, especially with Solar Thermal stations. You can minimise this processing by using either of these two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you invoke Power Model processing it allows you to process Chart (and Table) options multiple times without reprocessing the stations. You can then process Financial options multiple times. The process SIREN uses is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Displays the Power Model menu allowing you to specify initial options. This allows you to choose the stations of interest and the data options you want. This first display of the menu also allows you to save these options</li>
<li>Calls the appropriate SAM module for each chosen station, or other options as specified</li>
<li>Presents the tables and charts you have selected</li>
<li>Re-displays the Power Model menu allowing you to specify different growth options, storage options and charts. A number of options, such as <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> will no longer be available as they would require reprocessing the SAM models. To process these new options press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button. To exit this phase of processing press the
<strong>All Done</strong> or <strong>Do Financials</strong> button</li>
<li>If you have chosen to run the Financial Models the Financial Model menu will be displayed, allowing you to specify initial finance options. Press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to continue with these options</li>
<li>Calls the SAM financial module for each chosen station</li>
<li>Presents the financial table</li>
<li>Re displays the Financial Model menu allowing you to specify different options. Press the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to invoke these new options. To exit this phase of processing press the <strong>All Done</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<p>
<li>If the location and size of stations haven't changed you can avoid reprocessing stations by used Power data from a previous simulation run, using the following approach.
<ol>
<li>Choose the <em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> (<em>save_data</em>) Power Model option</li>
<li>Save the data file. This file contains power output for all stations in the current simulation. It should be located in the same folder as your scenario files (<em>scenarios</em> property of the <em>[Files]</em> Section). The data is saved as MWh with 4 decimal places because SAM uses kWh</li>
<li>With your spreadsheet application (Excel) update the scenarios and stations that you want to use the saved data with. Either add or use the column headed <em>Power File</em> to specify the filename you've selected for the power output. For each station enter the full name and extension of the file, for example, <em>Power_Table_Saved.xls</em></li>
<li>When you next run the simulation it will load this saved data rather than invoking the SAM module for each station that has an <em>Power File</em> entry</li>
<li>If the file is not found the SAM module will be re-invoked. So you can simply delete or rename the Power data file and re-run the simulation to get a new set of data points</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="optimise">Adjust Generation</h4>
<p>The <em>Generation - adjust generation</em> option allows you to easily adjust the contribution of each technology to the overall model by allowing you to apply a multiplier to the generation figures. The multiplier multiplies each hourly generation figure to approximate increasing the station by this size. This enables you to assess changes to the technology mix without having to alter individual stations. If you also choose the <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> option you can also do this adjustment for each station rather than each technology. This approach allows you to &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; with the generation mix without having to add or alter stations.</p>
<strong>Note:</strong> that the multiplied figures are not passed to the Financial model(s).</p>
<h4 id="augment">Augmented (non-renewable) Generation</h4>
<p>You can roughly estimate how much augmented (non-renewable) generation is required to meet the Load by selecting some appropriate Power Model options. This approach will indicate how much hourly demand can be met by generation, with or without storage, in the same hour, and how much excess renewable generation is spilled. If you choose the <em>Save chart data</em> and <em>Power by hour - augmented</em> option three tables will be produced. The first is actual data as in the graph, the second will adjust values to indicate the amount of generation from each component, and the third is a summary of the totals for the second table. This final table summarises how much demand is met by renewables and storage, how much has to be met from other sources (Augment) and how much renewable generation is spilled (that is, not used to meet demand or add to storage). This gives a slightly more accurate figure on how well your scenario meets hourly Load.
<h4>Saving the Current View</h4>
<p>It is possible to save the current view of the main SIREN window using the <strong>Save View</strong> (Ctrl+V) option. Depending on the options chosen you can choose to crop the view at the map boundary (<em>crop_save</em>=True) or to save the full view, and to save either the underlying map (<em>scene_save</em>=True) or the screen view. The image resolution can be different in the two options, dependent upon screen resolution, image resolution, screen window size and how much of the map is being saved.
</p>
<div class="experiment">
<p><strong>Optimise (experimental)</strong></p>
<p>SIREN also has an experimental approach to optimise the mix of technologies. If Load data is available the menu presented to adjust generation will have an option to &ldquo;optimise&rdquo; the renewable energy mix to best meet the Load. You will be presented with an <em>Optimise for:</em> pull-down list of periods to optimise for. You choose the desired period and then press the <em>Optimise</em> button. This will then do a least squares solution for adjustment multipliers to produce a generation profile that best matches the total load and load profile for that period. The data analysis is performed on either the average 24 hour period or detailed hourly figures for the chosen period (<em>optimise</em> property of the <em>[Power]</em> Section). If you don't wish to include a technology or station then uncheck the checkbox (to the right of the multiplier) for that technology or station. The generation produced by that technology or station will be removed from the optimisation. Depending on the <em>optimise_load</em> property of the <em>[Power]</em> Section you can also remove the Load (multiplied by it's current multiplier) from the analysis. Any computed negative multiplier will be set to zero, which is likely to result in the computed generation exceeding the load. The <em>Check / Uncheck all zeroes</em> check box enables you to include or exclude all zeroed stations from any further optimisation. The analysis is based upon the stations in your scenario and doesn't take into account how well placed they are within the network. If you want to reset all multipliers just Optimise for <em>None</em>.

<h2 id="files">SIREN File Formats</h2>
<p>SIREN accepts a number of file formats for each of the data files it uses. In many cases input files can be either a CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) file. Due to the initial source for each data file the format for each may be different. For CSV and Excel files the first cell for each column is usually taken as the column name.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Other than the Powermatch file, all Excel files output by SIREN are currently in XLS format (XLSX files require a different Python library to create them). Powermatch itself produces XLSX files.</p>
<p>The files and formats are as follow:</p>
<table border="0", class="none" style="margin-left:35px">
<tr class="none">

<td class="none">A KML (or KMZ) file defining areas within the map. These can be used to help visualise such things as environmentally sensitive areas. The property can be suffixed with a number 1 through 5 to enable a number of files with different areas to be loaded. Any string of &lt;coordinates&gt; in a &lt;LinearRing&gt; is used to draw an area within the grid boundary. Multiple zones can be defined. Colour for the grid areas can be set by the <em>grid_areas</em> Colour option</td>

As such, this should be a very simplified grid and relies on all lines connecting to one another in a true grid network. Making this grid too complex slows down the process of connecting lines and tracing paths. Colours for the lines can be set by either &lt;styleUrl&gt; colour elements in the KML file or <em>grid_colour</em> Colour options, where <em>colour</em> equals the lines' &lt;styleUrl&gt;, e.g.<em>grid_s_66kv=#774110</em>.</td>

<h2 id="notes">Supporting Notes</h2>
<h3 id="map">Obtaining a Suitable Map Image</h3>
<p>Among other publicly available resources, OpenStreetMap provides a set of open map tiles (&ldquo;Slippy Map&rdquo; tiles. Refer <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map" target="_blank">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map</a>) which can be stitched together into a single image. These produce a traditional map type. A satellite map can be obtained from MapQuest (<a href="https://www.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/" target="_blank">https://www.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/</a> or you can save an image from another source such as Google Maps. Map data copyright (&copy;) OpenStreetMap contributors CC-BY-SA <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank"> http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</a>. You can obtain a suitable image using <code>getmap</code>.</p>
<h4>getmap</h4>
<p><code>getmap</code> is a program that can be used to create a map image for any area of the globe. Using this program you can obtain a map from one of the two sources above. You specify:
<ul>
<li>For both, the bounding coordinates for the chosen area, and a name for the file to create a suitable map image</li>
<li>For OpenStreetMap, a zoom level and a URL template (Internet address) for the map tiles. The default value (<code>http://[abc].tile.openstreetmap.org/zoom/x/y.png</code>) represents the normal OpenStreetMap tiles</li>
<li>For MapQuest, the width and height for the image file you wish to create. The ratio of these values will affect the area the map represents</li>
</ul>
<p>You can invoke the program either by choosing <code>getmap</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>getmap.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to allow you to define the map/image desired. <code>getmap</code> displays a map of the world to visualise the chosen are of interest at a global scale. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Area of interest</em>. You specify the boundaries for the area of the world you want a map generated for. This can be chosen either by pressing <em>Choose area via Map</em> to invoke <code>worldwindow</code> (see <a href="#worldwindow">Select area on world map</a>) to choose the area on a world map or by specifying the bounding coordinates for the area:
<ul>
<li><em>North</em>. Upper latitude</li>
<li><em>West</em>. Left (west) longitude</li>
<li><em>South</em>. Lower latitude</li>
<li><em>East</em>. Right (east) longitude</li>
</ul>
You can alternate between both approaches to choose the desired area. If you have passed a SIREN Preferences file or invoked <code>getmap</code> from within SIREN the bounding coordinates will be set to those of the current map. North and South can range from +85.06 to -85.06 degrees and East and West from -180 to +180</li>
<li><em>Map Scale (Zoom)</em>. The scale of the map can be from 0 - 1:500 million - to 11 - 1:250,000 (OpenStreetMap has zoom levels to 19, 1:1,000). You can either use the arrows to increase or decrease the level or type in a value. The program will show an approximate scale for the level chosen</li>
<li><em>URL template</em>. The URL template for the location of the map tiles. The default value, <code>http://[abc].tile.openstreetmap.org/zoom/x/y.png</code>, is for OSM &lsquo;standard&rsquo; style maps. You can override this value to specify a different source (for example, <code>http://tile.stamen.com/terrain-background/zoom/x/y.png</code> for Migurski's Terrain; US-only)</li>
<li><em>Image Width</em>. The width of the image to be created (for MapQuest)</li>
<li><em>Image Height</em>. The height of the image to be created (for MapQuest)</li>
<li><em>Image Filename</em>. Use this to specify the name and location for the map file. If you click on the field it will allow you to specify an alternative name and location for the file (you can't type into the field itself). If you specify a filetype it must be a suitable image format. The default format is <em>.png</em></li>
<li><em>Properties</em>. This is a read only field that is filled in when a map is created. These properties should be copied into the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file. For OpenStreetMap images the <strong>coordinates</strong> are correct while they <strong>are likely to be incorrect for MapQuest - this is a work-in-progress.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are six buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Choose area via Map</em> (as above) will open the world map
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Query Map</em> will calculate the size of the map and indicate the boundaries for the map on the world view. The size of the boundary area is dependent on the map scale (zoom)</li>
<li><em>Get Map</em> will produce the map. It downloads map tiles from OpenStreetMap and stitches them into a single image file at the location specified. It will update the Properties field with the valuables to be added into the Preferences file. If you are downloading a map with many tiles this may take some time so please be patient. There is a progress bar that will indicate how far along the process the program is</li>
<li><em>MapQuest</em> will produce a map from MapQuest. It issues a request to MapQuest for a static map with the coordinates and image properties you specify. The coordinates for the image (map) should contain your specified area but the exact bounding coordinates are likely to be different - this is a work-in-progress</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>After producing the map you should copy the contents of the <em>Properties</em> field into the <a href="#p_map">[Map]</a> Section of the Preferences file.</p>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      getmap.exe &lt;north_latitude west_longitude south_latitude east_longitude zoom output_file_name zoom=zoom width=width height=height url=map_url&gt;
</pre>
<p>The first six parameters are positional.</p>
<p>An output_file_name of <em>?</em> will calculate the size of the map and indicate the boundaries for the map</p>
<h4>Map Preferences</h4>
<p>Many options can be specified by a preferences file. The following properties in the <strong>[Map]</strong> Section are created by <code>getmap</code>.</p>

<h3 id="swisupd">Obtaining Current SWIS Facilities</h3>
<p>The initial SWIS data provided with SIREN is for 2014 and 2015 with existing renewable stations at that time. Updates to this data are available on the <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/" target="_blank">AEMO Market Data website</a>. The SWIS data used by SIREN is as follows.</p>
<h4>SWIS Network</h4>
<p>SIREN uses a simplified network to reduce the overhead in adding stations into the network and to trace their links to the Perth Load Centre. This simple network was derived from a national network diagram for Australia available in a number of formats, including as a KMZ file, from Geoscience Australia (<a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/electricity-transmission-lines" target="_blank">Electricity Transmission Lines</a>; accessed Oct 2017)</p>
<p>There is also a list of Australian power stations available (<a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/power-stations" target="_blank">Power Stations</a>; accessed Oct 2017)</p>
<h4 id="updateswis">Existing Stations (Facilities)</h4>
<p>SIREN uses the list of <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facilities" target="_blank">registered facilities</a> available from AEMO (specifically <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/datafiles/facilities/facilities.csv" target="_blank">facilities.csv</a>) for it's existing stations. If you want an updated version you can use <code>updateswis</code> to obtain the current list (see below).</p>
<h4>Load Data</h4>
<p>The load data for the SWIS has been obtained from <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#load-summary" target="_blank">Load Summary</a> data available from AEMO. SIREN uses hourly load data rather than half hourly. The figures used are derived by summing the &lsquo;Operational Load (MWh)&rsquo; data for the two half hourly intervals. You can use <code>updateswis</code> to obtain the latest load data (see below). The SWIS load data is generally available mid-month for two months prior.</p>
<p>The AEMO also publish <a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facility-scada" target="_blank">facility SCADA data</a>.</p>
<h4>updateswis</h4>
<p><code>updateswis.py</code> is a Python program that can be used to access the current list of facilities (power stations) for the SWIS and to obtain recent load data.
The program will download the list of existing stations and optionally update the file SIREN uses for existing stations (<em>grid_stations</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file). To aid readability you can optionally produce an additional file, either CSV or Excel (XLS), that will save the list in the same format as a SIREN scenario file.
Load data can also be downloaded for prior years to a filename defined by the <em>load</em> property of the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file.</p>
<p>You can run <code>updateswis</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>updateswis.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Host site</em>. The URL of the AEMO Market Data website</li>
<li>Existing Stations (Facilities)
<ul>
<li><em>File location</em>. The location of the file on the AEMO Market Data website</li>
<li><em>Target file</em>. The target file for the existing stations. The tool will examine and existing file and evaluate what changes have been made. The filename is derived from the <em>grid_stations</em> property</li>
<li><em>Excel file</em>. Setting a filename here will cause an additional file to be created in SIREN scenario format</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System Load
<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. The year you want load data for</li>
<li><em>Wrap to prior year</em>. To enable you to use (more) recent load data you can check this option to indicate load data should wrap to the prior year. As an example, if load data is available up until April of the current year <code>updateswis</code> will use load data from the prior year for May onwards to give a full year of data</li>
<li><em>Load File location</em>. The location of the file on the AEMO Market Data website. The year will be updated when you update the Year field so you shouldn't need to change this field</li>
<li><em>Target load file</em>. The target file for the load data. The filename is derived from the <em>load</em> property. The year will be updated when you update the Year field so you shouldn't need to change this field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Update Existing Stations</em> will download the current file on the AEMO site and compare it to the existing list available to SIREN. If there are changes you will be presented with a brief summary of changes and given the option to replace the existing file. The initial window will then be displayed with a brief message</li>
<li><em>Update Load file</em> will download load files from the AEMO site and create an updated load data file</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      updateswis.exe &lt;SIREN.ini parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows. If either wrap or year is passed as a parameter load data will be obtained, otherwise facility data will be obtained.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SIREN.ini</em> is the SIREN Preferences file. It is required and must be the first parameter</li>
<li><em>host=</em> Host site</li>
<li><em>url=</em> File location on the AEMO website</li>
<li><em>target=</em> Target File</li>
<li><em>excel=</em> Excel File</li>
<li><em>wrap=</em> Indicate to wrap data or not</li>
<li><em>year=</em> Indicate which year to obtain load data for</li>

<h3 id="reanalysis">Obtaining and Using Satellite Reanalysis Data for SAM weather files</h3>
<p>SAM uses meteorological solar and wind data to model output of various renewable energy technologies. Satellite data is a suitable source to generate data files containing all weather variables required for input to SAM. NASA MERRA-2 data has been used as one source of data by SIREN since 2015. More recently ECMWF ERA5 data has been identified as another source. Both sources provide the hourly data required for the SAM models and show strong correlation between generation calculated by the SAM models and actual SCADA generation data (<a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facility-scada" target="_blank">AEMO facility SCADA data</a>) for the SWIS. In recent years the overall generation figures from MERRA-2-derived weather files is 25% to 30% higher than the actual SCADA generation figures while the ERA5-derived figures are around 2% higher suggesting ERA5 may be a better source for weather data (refer to <a href="#ecorr">Validation of ECMWF ERA5 Data and the SAM Models</a> and <a href="#corr">Validation of NASA MERRA-2 Data and the SAM Models</a>). A more detailed and (geographically) wider analysis is warranted.
<h4 id="era">Obtaining and Using ECMWF ERA5 Data for SAM weather files</h3>
<h4 id="era1">Using ECMWF ERA5 Data for input to SAM</h4>
<p>ECMWF ERA5 data is a suitable source to generate data files containing all weather variables required for input to SAM. It allows weather files to be created on a grid of 0.25 degree of longitude by 0.25 degree of latitude or at a larger scale. This is approximately an area of 25 km x 25 km for the SWIS latitudes.</p>
<p><em>ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present</em> provides data suitable to our needs.</p>
<h4 id="era5">Obtaining ERA5 Data</h4>
<p>ERA5 Data is publicly available and the following steps can be used to obtain the required data.</p>
<p>To access ERA5 data you need to <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register" target="_blank">create a CDS account</a></p>
<p>Once set up you can either fill in the data request form or use <code>getera5</code> - see <a href="#getera5">Get ERA5 Files</a>.
The data request form is at <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form" target="_blank">ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present</a>.
To fill in the form you choose the following options:
<ul>
<li>Product type - Reanalysis</li>
<li>Variable
<ul>
<li>Temperature and Pressure - 2m temperature, Surface pressure</li>
<li>Wind - 100m u-component of wind, 100m u-component of wind, 10m u-component of wind, 10m v-component of wind</li>
<li>Radiation and heat - Surface net solar radiation, Surface solar radiation downwards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year - a single year</li>
<li>Month - either all months or a single month</li>
<li>Day - all 31 days</li>
<li>Time - all 24 hours (00:00 to 23:00)</li>
<li>Geograhical area
<ul>
<li>Sub-region extraction - North, West, East, South</li>
</ul>
<li>Format - NetCDF (experimental)</li>
<li>Submit Form</li>
</ul>
<p>For timezones greater than zero, such as the SWIS (8 hours), you also need to process a request for Month = 12 and Day = 31. For timezones less than zero you also need to process a request for Month = 1 and Day = 1.</p>
<p>You can see the progress of <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/yourrequests" target="_blank">your requests</a>. Once complete you need to save the file in the format <em>era5_data_yyyy.nc</em> or <em>era5_data_yyyymm.nc</em>.
<h4 id="getera5">Get ERA5 Files</h4>
<p><code>getera5</code> provides an easier alternate way of downloading ERA5 files than that described above. This approach launches a program that uses the CDS API, <code>cdsapi</code>, to issue the data request as above and save the file or files in the target folder. You still need to create a CDS account.</p>
<p>When you first execute <code>getera5</code> it will request the check for a <code>.cdsapirc</code> file and if it can't find one it will prompt for the details required - these are your CDS UID and API Key which are displayed on your CDS User profile. If you've invoked <code>getera5</code> in a Windows terminal window and a <code>HOME</code> environment variable does not exist you will need to close and reopen a new terminal window to make the environment variable available to <code>getera5</code>.</p>
<h5>getera5</h5>
<p><code>getera5</code> is a program that can be used to download ERA5 data files required to create weather files for SAM. You can invoke the program either by choosing <code>getera5</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>getmerra2.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> folder. The program accepts a SIREN Preferences file as an optional parameter. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Area of Interest</em>. Area of interest for files to be downloaded. There are three ways the area can be chosen:
<ol>
<li>Pressing <em>Choose area via Map</em> to invoke <code>worldwindow</code> (see <a href="#worldwindow">Select area on world map</a>) to choose the area on a world map</li>
<li>Specifying the bounding coordinates for the area:
<ul>
<li><em>North</em>. Upper latitude</li>
<li><em>West</em>. Left (west) longitude</li>
<li><em>South</em>. Lower latitude</li>
<li><em>East</em>. Right (east) longitude</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choosing the centre point and dimensions for the area of interest:
<ul>
<li><em>(Centre) Lat</em>. Centre latitude</li>
<li><em>(Centre) Lon</em>. Centre longitude</li>
<li><em>Degrees (Lat)</em>. The dimension in degrees north south</li>
<li><em>Degrees (Lon)</em>. The dimension in degrees east west</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
You can alternate between these approaches to choose the desired area. If you have passed a SIREN Preferences file or invoked <code>getera5</code> from within SIREN the bounding coordinates will be set to those of the current map
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The behaviour of the bounding coordinates fields are a little quirky in that they will adjust themselves so the west (left) value is always west of the east value and the north (upper) value is always higher than the south value
</li>
<li><em>Grid</em>. The size of the desired grid latitude and longitude. These can be in increments of 0.25 degrees up to a maximum of 3 degrees</li>
<li><em>Start month</em>. The first month to be downloaded. The CDS API is flexible on the range of dates that can be requested. For pragmatic purposes <code>getera5</code> requests data as a range of months</li>
<li><em>End month</em>. The last month to be downloaded. If a Start month of 1 and an End month of 12 is chosen the program will request a year of data as a single file</li>
<li><em>Target Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the ERA5 files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are five buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Choose area via Map</em> (at top of window; as above) will open the world map
<li><em>Done</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Get Data</em> will invoke one of more new tasks to request and download the ERA5 data for the selected area and date range. As part of the execution a log file will be saved to the Target Folder</li>
<li><em>Check Data</em> will interrogate ERA5 files in the Target Folder to provide the boundaries for the Area of Interest and set the starting month to download the next month in sequence. The interrogation may cater for files in yearly sub-folders</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>Downloading the ERA5 data are performed by new tasks allowing you to close the <code>getera5</code> window once you have requested the files. Depending on the area and date range the process of downloading is likely to take significant time. A log file with the same name as the target file and a file type of <em>log</em> (e.g. <em>era5_data_202301.log</em>) will contain the results of the request and indicate it's success or otherwise.</p>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      getera5.exe &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>check</em>. If this parameter is passed the program will interrogate ERA5 files in the target folder to provide the boundaries for the area of interest and set the starting date to download the next month in sequence</li>
<li><em>config=</em> or <em>configuration=</em> or <em>ini=</em>. Alternative Preferences file. Default value is <em>getfiles.ini</em>. You can also specify just the filename</li>
<li><em>date=</em> or <em>year=</em>. The month or year to download. The format is <em>yyyymm</em> or <em>yyyy</em></li>
<li><em>dir=</em> or <em>folder=</em> or <em>target=</em> or <em>tgt_dir=</em>. The target folder for the ERA5 files to be downloaded to</li>
<li><em>get</em> or <em>wget</em> or <em>spawn</em>. Passing this parameter will cause <code>wget</code> to be launched to download the files. If not passed the <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.txt</em> and <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.bat</em> files are created but <code>wget</code> is not launched</li>
<li><em>lat2=</em> or <em>bottomlat=</em> or <em>botlat=</em> or <em>southlat=</em> or <em>south=</em>. The south latitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lat1=</em> or <em>toplat=</em> or <em>northlat=</em> or <em>north=</em>. The north latitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lon1=</em> or <em>leftlon=</em> or <em>westlon=</em> or <em>west=</em>. The west longitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lon2=</em> or <em>rightlon=</em> or <em>eastlon=</em> or <em>east=</em>. The east longitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>grd1=</em> or <em>grid1=</em> or <em>latgrid</em>. The grid size for latitude</li>
<li><em>grd2=</em> or <em>grid2=</em> or <em>longrid</em>. The grid size for longitude</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ol class="none">
<li>The first time you use <code>getera5</code> you should run it interactively to ensure the correct environment (e.g. <code>.cdsapirc</code> file) is established</li>
<li>If you invoke the program with target folder and check parameters the program will be launched to download more recent files into the target folder with the same area of interest as the existing files.</li>
</ol>

<h4  id="ecorr">Validation of ECMWF ERA5 Data and the SAM Models</h4>
ECMWF ERA5 data allows weather files to be created on a grid of 0.25 degree of longitude by 0.25 degree of latitude. This is approximately an area of 25 km x 25 km for the SWIS latitudes.</p>
<p>Initial correlations between generation calculated by SAM models using ECMWF ERA5 data and actual SCADA generation data (<a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facility-scada" target="_blank">AEMO facility SCADA data</a>) obtained by SEN for 2022 are strong enough to support the use of ECMWF ERA5-derived data for the purposes of the simulation. Average correlation was 0.82, varying from 0.65 to 0.83 for wind and 0.77 to 0.93 for utility scale PV farms on the SWIS network. The following figure graphically presents this correlation for 2022 by showing progressive calculated generation (solid lines) with actual SCADA data (dotted lines) for each renewable generation station on the SWIS. There is some variability between the two sets of data for each stations but total calculated generation is within 2% of actual SCADA data.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Open a terminal window and navigate to the sub-folder you want the files downloaded to
<ol>
<li>
Run the wget command as displayed in the FTP Subset Results page. This uses the downloaded list. You can copy and paste the command into the terminal window. The command will be something like
<pre>
wget --load-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --save-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --auth-no-challenge=on --keep-session-cookies -i ...
</pre>
You should use the <code>--content-disposition</code> option in your wget command to avoid <em>Filename too long</em> errors (that is...
<pre>
wget --load-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --save-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --auth-no-challenge=on --keep-session-cookies --content-disposition -i <list of urls>
</pre>
If your userid contains a space you may need to enclose <code>~/.urs_cookies</code> in quotes, e.g. <code>"~/.urs_cookies"</code>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process uses <code>wget</code> to download the MERRA-2 data files. Typically there is a single file for each day of interest so using wget simplifies the process of downloading them. Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet protocols. There are versions available for most platforms.</p>
<p><strong>wget for Windows</strong></p>
<p>Earlier versions of wget for windows will not work with the requirements for URS authentication. Version 1.18 has been successfully tested. The following steps highlight an approach:
<ol>
<li>Obtain a suitable version of wget, such as <a href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/releases/wget-1.18-win32.zip" target="_blank">wget-1.18-win32.zip</a> for the full package or <a href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/current/wget.exe">wget.exe</a> for just wget itself. Only the .exe file is required</li>
<li>Create a <code>.netrc</code> file as described in the Wget with URS Authentication link above</li>
<li>Create a <code>HOME</code> environment variable which points to the folder containing the <code>.netrc</code> file (typically this is set to <code>Users/username</code>)</li>
<li>Open a terminal window, navigate to where you have the list of urls and invoke <code>wget</code></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="getmerra2">Get MERRA-2 Files</h4>
<p><code>getmerra2</code> provides an easier alternate way of downloading MERRA-2 files than that described in <a href="#merra3">Obtaining data</a>. This approach uses <code>wget</code> but removes the need to manually follow those steps above. You still need to <a href="#merra2a">Register for access</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Downloading the MERRA-2 files are performed by new tasks allowing you to close the <code>getmerra2</code> window once you have requested the files. Depending on the area and date range the process of downloading is likely to take significant time. A log file named <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.log</em> will be produced, where <em>type</em> is either wind or solar and <em>yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.log</em> is the date and time <code>wget</code> was invoked. A file named <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.txt</em> will contain the list of files to be downloaded and <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.bat</em> will contain the <code>wget</code> command (in case you encounter problems).</p>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      getmerra2.exe &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>check</em>. If this parameter is passed the program will interrogate MERRA-2 files in the target folder to provide the boundaries for the area of interest and set the starting date to download the next day in sequence and the end date to 42 days prior to the current date</li>
<li><em>coll=</em> or <em>collection=</em>. The MERRA-2 collection, either <em>solar</em> or <em>wind</em>. Default value is <em>solar</em>. You can also specify just the collection value, i.e. <em>solar</em> or <em>wind</em></li>
<li><em>config=</em> or <em>configuration=</em> or <em>ini=</em>. Alternative Preferences file. Default value is <em>getfiles.ini</em>. You can also specify just the filename</li>
<li><em>date=</em> or <em>date1=</em> or <em>strtdate=</em> or <em>startdate=</em>. The first date to download. The format is <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em></li>
<li><em>date2=</em> or <em>enddate=</em>. The last date to download. The format is <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em></li>
<li><em>dir=</em> or <em>folder=</em> or <em>target=</em> or <em>tgt_dir=</em>. The target folder for the MERRA-2 files to be downloaded to</li>
<li><em>get</em> or <em>wget</em> or <em>spawn</em>. Passing this parameter will cause <code>wget</code> to be launched to download the files. If not passed the <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.txt</em> and <em>wget_type_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.bat</em> files are created but <code>wget</code> is not launched</li>
<li><em>lat2=</em> or <em>bottomlat=</em> or <em>botlat=</em> or <em>southlat=</em> or <em>south=</em>. The south latitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lat1=</em> or <em>toplat=</em> or <em>northlat=</em> or <em>north=</em>. The north latitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lon1=</em> or <em>leftlon=</em> or <em>westlon=</em> or <em>west=</em>. The west longitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>lon2=</em> or <em>rightlon=</em> or <em>eastlon=</em> or <em>east=</em>. The east longitude of the area of interest</li>
<li><em>year=</em> As an alternative to passing the start and end dates you can pass the year of interest. If passed, the first date will be 31 December of the prior year and the last date will be 1 January of the following year</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ol class="none">
<li>The first time you use <code>getmerra2</code> you should run it interactively to ensure the correct environment (e.g. <code>.netrc</code> file) is established</li>
<li>If you invoke the program with collection, target folder, check and wget parameters <code>wget</code> will be launched to download more recent files into the target folder with the same area of interest as the existing files.</li>
<li>Occasionally MERRA-2 datasets will be reprocessed, e.g. September 2020, which may result in a change to the location of the files on the NASA MERRA-2 server. This may require the filename property in the [getmerra2] section of the Preferences file used by <code>getmerra2</code>. For example, for September 2020 the string &lsquo;MERRA2_400&rsquo; needs to be changed to &lsquo;MERRA2_401&rsquo; to download files for that month.</li>

<h4 id="corr">Validation of NASA MERRA-2 Data and the SAM Models</h3>
NASA MERRA-2 data allows weather files to be created on a grid of 0.625 degree of longitude by 0.5 degree of latitude. This is approximately an area of 55 km x 55 km for the SWIS latitudes.</p>
<p>Initial correlations between generation calculated by SAM models using NASA MERRA data and actual SCADA generation data (<a href="http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/#facility-scada" target="_blank">AEMO facility SCADA data</a>) obtained by SEN in 2014 are strong enough to support the use of NASA MERRA-derived data for the purposes of the simulation. Average correlation was 0.77, varying from 0.70 to 0.83 for wind and 0.95 for the one utility scale PV farm on the SWIS network. The level of correlation measured in 2014 has continued over the years. The following figure graphically presents this correlation for 2022 by showing progressive calculated generation (solid lines) with actual SCADA data (dotted lines) for each renewable generation station on the SWIS. Average correlation for 2022 was 0.80, varying from 0.56 to 0.78 for wind and and 0.75 to 0.92 for utility scale PV farms on the SWIS network. There is some variability between the two sets of data for each stations and total calculated generation is about 25% greater than actual SCADA data.</p>
<p>
<img src="scada_vs_sam_2022_detailed.png" alt="Correlation">
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Initially, the <em>swgnt</em> (surface net downward shortwave flux) MERRA variable was used to generate the solar weather variables. This produced outputs that were slightly lower than observed data. To compensate for this a losses percentage of 5 (percent) was used for the SAM pvwattsv5 model. Subsequent work has identified the <em>swgdn</em> (surface incoming shortwave flux) MERRA-2 variable as a more appropriate resource. Using this variable, a losses percentage of 14 - the SAM default - can be used. Validation using either variable (swgnt and 5%, or swgdn and 14%) produces essentially identical results and correlations.

<h4 id="makeweather">Produce wind and solar weather files</h4>
<h5>makeweatherfiles</h5>
<p><code>makeweatherfiles</code> is a program that can be used to produce solar and/or wind weather files for input to SAM. The program generates SMW (preferred for SAM) or CSV format solar resource files and SRW format wind resource files. These file formats have been chosen as they're easier to generate than other formats. Using the program you specify the source folder for either the ERA5 or  MERRA-2 data files, the time zone for the area of interest, a file format and target folder for the weather files. The program will generate files for each of the ERA5 or MERRA-2 grid squares within the chosen data files or optionally for a number of latitude and longitude positions. You can invoke the program either by choosing <code>makeweatherfiles</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>makeweatherfiles.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> (or <em>makeweatherfiles</em>) folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. Year of interest. The naming conventions for MERRA-2 files include the date so this defines the date range. The tool processes dates from the last day of the prior year through to the first day of the next year (ignoring 29 February)</li>
<li><em>Wrap to prior year</em>. To enable you to use (more) recent weather data this option will indicate that weather data should wrap to the prior year. As an example, if you have downloaded data up until April for the current year <code>makeweatherfiles</code> will use weather data from the prior year for May onwards to give a full year of data. The     data for both years must reside in the same folder (or the next sub-folder if yearly folders are used) and have the same dimensions for latitude and longitude</li>
<li><em>Ignore data gaps</em>. This option will cater for individual MERRA-2 files containing different dimensions for latitude and longitude. If this option is selected the program will create weather files where there are gaps for 21 days or less. If there are more gaps the file will not be created.
<ul>
<li>MERRA-2
<ul>
<li>The program does require a MERRA-2 file for each day of the year (It is possible to copy another file, say for the same day of another year, and rename it to &ldquo;replace&rdquo; the missing file)</li>
<li>In creating a solar weather file the program requires both wind and solar MERRA-2 files, so any gaps in either dataset will result in a gap in the solar weather file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ERA5
<ul>
<li>The program requires a ERA5 file for each month of the year</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Time Zone</em>. The (solar) time zone for the area of interest. This is used to create suitable weather files where the first hour in the file is the first hour of the year in the local time zone. A value of <em>auto</em> will cause the program to use the (first) longitude and a value of <em>best</em> will cause the program to use the time zone with the most longitude values in the MERRA-2 data files to calculate the time zone</li>
<li><em>Solar Format</em>. The solar option can produce weather files in either of two formats - SMW or CSV format. This option allows you to choose your preferred one. SMW format is suitable for SAM while it may have trouble with the CSV format</li>
<li><em>Solar Variable</em>. There are two MERRA-2 solar variables to use to create weather files - <em>swgdn</em> or <em>swgnt</em>. The equivalent ERA5 variables are - <em>ssrd</em> and <em>ssr</em></li>
<li><em>Hub height</em>. To extrapolate wind data above the 50 metre maximum in the MERRA-2 data, or 100 metres in ERA5 data. This can be used to cater for wind turbines with higher hub heights. SAM's <em>windpower</em> model expects wind data within 35 metres of the hub height.
<br /><strong>Note</strong>: SIREN can dynamically extrapolate wind data when running Powermodel so if using SIREN there is no need to produce extrapolated wind data</li>
<li>Extrapolation will use the chosen <em>law</em>, either <em>logarithmic</em>, the default, or <em>Hellmann</em> as described below</li>
<li><em>Coordinates</em>. Rather than producing weather files for each grid cell in the chosen area you can restrict it by passing a string of comma-separated latitude and longitude values. The tool will then generate files for just these coordinates.
<ul>
<li>For latitudes and longitudes that don't match cell dimensions in the MERRA-2 files values will be calculated from ratios of values for the surrounding cells</li>
<li>If there are data gaps values will be calculated from the nearest cells</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Copy folder down</em>. This is an ease of use field. If this is checked any changes to the Solar Source Folder field will be propagated to the other two Folder fields</li>
<li><em>Solar/ERA5 Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the MERRA-2 solar (<em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx</em>) source files or ERA5 data files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field). This location is used for ERA5 data files and for MERRA-2 it's only used for solar files</li>
<li><em>Wind Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the MERRA-2 wind (<em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx</em>) source files. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field). This location is not required for ERA5 data files. For MERRA-2 files it is used for both solar and wind files, so you need to specify it in all cases</li>
<li><em>Target Folder</em>. Use this to specify the location for the weather files produced by the tool. To change the location you need to click on the field and navigate to the correct folder (you can't type into the field)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are six buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Done</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Solar Files</em> will produce solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Produce Wind Files</em> will produce wind weather files</li>
<li><em>Update Wind Files</em> will update existing wind weather files with extrapolated wind speed</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
<li><em>File Info</em> Display details about the weather file dimensions and variables</li>
</ul>
<p>Creation of weather files may take some time so please be patient. There are two progress bars that will display to indicate how far along the process the program is. The tool will produce an output report which will include the list of weather files produced. The report will include a return code as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 1; margin: 1">
<li><em>0.</em> Successful execution</li>
<li><em>1.</em> Successful execution, however, the time zone chosen does not match the time zone(s) suggested by the MERRA-2 data files. If you chose <em>auto</em> or <em>best</em> this indicates more than one time zone is suggested by the MERRA-2 data files</li>
<li><em>2.</em> Error with coordinates field</li>
<li><em>3.</em> Invalid output file format specified. It must be one of <em>csv</em>, <em>smw</em>, <em>srw</em>, or <em>wind</em></li>
<li><em>4.</em> Data file not found. The program requires filename(s) to be in a specific format so either the filename doesn't match that format or the source folder is incorrect</li>
<li><em>5.</em> Error with data file. If you encounter a MERRA-2 error &ldquo;Regridder Error. File generation error: Failed to create working directory.&rdquo; you might attempt to obtain a valid copy of the file in error by entering it's URL entry from the MERRA-2 search results into your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      makeweatherfiles.exe &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>

<li><em>year=</em> Year of interest</li>
<li><em>zone=</em> or <em>timezone=</em> The (solar) time zone for the area of interest</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ol>
<li>MERRA-2
<ul>
<li>The program should also handle MERRA (version 1) data files downloaded (probably) prior to February 2016</li>
<li>The program assumes each day of data is a separate file and uses the filename to as a &ldquo;key&rdquo; to the data. It relies on:
<ul>
<li>The string <em>MERRA</em> being part of the filename</li>
<li>Filenames contain <em>tavg1_2d_slv_Nx.YYYYMMDD</em> for wind and <em>tavg1_2d_rad_Nx.YYYYMMDD</em> for solar, where <em>YYYYMMDD</em> indicates the data file for that day</li>
<li>All files of the same type (solar or wind) being in the same folder</em>
<li>If you download two copies of the same file wget will append a number to the second copy filename, e.g. ...nc4.1. At present these will be ignored</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ERA5
<ul>
<li>Normally, the program assumes each month of data is a separate file and uses the filename as a &ldquo;key&rdquo; to the data. Filenames are of the format <em>era5_data_&lt;yyyymm&gt;.nc</em></li>
<li>It is also possible to use a single file for a year, of the format <em>era5_data_&lt;yyyy&gt;.nc</em></li>
<li>When processing the data the program also looks for data for the last day of the prior year (for timezones > 0) or the first day of the next year (for timezones < 0). It will look for one of the appropriate month file, the appropriate year file, or a file for the single day (<em>era5_data_&lt;yyyymmdd&gt;.nc</em> format)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A packaged version of <code>makeweatherfiles</code> for Windows is available as a self-extracting zip file from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/</a>. The file is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/files/sen_makeweather_getera.exe/download" target="_blank">sen_makeweather_getera.exe</a> (the package has been created with PyInstaller) and contains <code>makeweatherfiles</code>, <code>getera5</code>, which enables ERA5 files to be downloaded, and <code>getmerra2</code>, which enables MERRA-2 files to be downloaded. This package allows you to create SAM weather files from ERA5 or MERRA-2 files without requiring any other parts of SIREN</a></li>
<li>With increasing hub heights associated with larger turbines the SAM models are impacted by the lack of suitable wind speed data at greater heights. The MERRA-2 climate data has a maximum wind speed height of 50 metres which will cope with hub heights up to around 85 metres. The ERA5 data has a maximum wind speed height of 100 metres which will cope with hub heights up to around 135 metres. To overcome the wind data limitation the Hub height parameter can be used to extrapolate wind speeds to a greater (hub) height. <code>makeweatherfiles</code> will extrapolate wind speed using either of two commonly used laws (models). The law to be used can be specified in the <em>extrapolate</em> property of the [makeweatherfiles] Section of the <a href="#getfiles">getfiles.ini</a> Preferences file, and can be either <em>logarithmic</em>, the default, or <em>Hellmann</em>. This additional data will be added to the normal wind file.
<p>Discussions on the two wind profile laws can be found at &lsquo;Wind profile power law&rsquo; (aka Hellmann law; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_profile_power_law" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_profile_power_law</a>) and &lsquo;Log wind profile&rsquo; (aka logarithmic law; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_wind_profile" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_wind_profile</a>). The Hellmann law tends to give slightly higher wind speeds. &lsquo;Methodologies Used in the Extrapolation of Wind Speed Data at Different Heights and Its Impact in the Wind Energy Resource Assessment in a Region&rsquo; (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221912731_Methodologies_Used_in_the_Extrapolation_of_Wind_Speed_Data_at_Different_Heights_and_Its_Impact_in_the_Wind_Energy_Resource_Assessment_in_a_Region" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221912731_Methodologies_Used_in_the_Extrapolation_of_Wind_Speed_Data_at_Different_Heights_and_Its_Impact_in_the_Wind_Energy_Resource_Assessment_in_a_Region</a>) provides a fuller discussion on the topic.</p></li>

<h4 id="usage">Using getera5, getmerra2 and makeweatherfiles</h4>
<p>To make use of <code>getera5</code>, <code>getmerra2</code> and <code>makeweatherfiles</code> the following steps should help:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getera5</code> get ERA5 data</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you <a href="#getera5">create a CDS account</a> as described above to gain access to the ERA5 data</p></li>
<li>Set up a <code>.cdapirc</code> file and for Windows a <code>HOME</code> environment variable. The first time you invoke <code>getera5</code> it will allow you to set these up</p></li>
<li>Run <code>getera5</code> to get the ERA5 data for your area of interest</p>
<ol>
<li>You specify the bounding coordinates for your area of interest. For example, for the SWIS in Western Australia you could input North -26.0, South -36.0, West 113.125 and East 122.5</li>
<li>Specify the month range. To create a SAM weather file you need at least one year of data plus the last day of the prior year and/or the first day of the next year. As an example Start month: 01/15 (or 2015-01) and End month: 12/15 (or 2015-12) will download data for 2016. ERA5 data is based upon UTC while SAM files are local time. In the case of the SWIS, UTC+8, the first 8 hours of the year will be in the last day of the previous year; for UTC-n, the last n hours of the year will be in the first day of the next year. When you request the data <code>getera5</code> will check if the file for the required extra day exists and if not it will submit an additional request for the single day of data</li>
<li>Click on the target folder field to specify a location for the ERA5 data</li>
<li>Click <em>Get Data</em> to submit the request. When you click the buttons <code>getera5</code> will launch separate tasks to download the required files into the target folder. You can Quit out of <code>getera5</code> as this stage. The tasks will probably take a while to run as they have to request and download individual files for each month or the full year. The output and success will be in a log file in the target folder</li>
<li>If you click <em>Check Data</em> <code>getera5</code> will interrogate ERA5 files in the appropriate Target Folder to provide the boundaries for the Area of Interest and set the starting date to download the next month in sequence. The interrogation will cater for files in yearly sub-folders</li>
</ol></p></li>
<li>Once the ERA5 files are downloaded run <code>makeweatherfiles</code> to create the SAM weather files</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>getmerra2</code> get MERRA-2 data</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you <a href="#merra2a">Register for access</a> as described above to gain access to the MERRA-2 data</p></li>
<li>Set up a <code>.netrc</code> file and for Windows a <code>HOME</code> environment variable. The first time you invoke <code>getmerra2</code> it will allow you to set these up</p></li>
<li>Run <code>getmerra2</code> to get the MERRA-2 data for your area of interest</p>
<ol>
<li>You specify the bounding coordinates for your area of interest. For example, for the SWIS in Western Australia you could input North -26.0, South -36.0, West 113.125 and East 122.5. The area has to be at least 1 degree of latitude high by 1.25 degree longitude wide</li>
<li>Specify the date range. To create a SAM weather file you need at least one year of data plus the last day of the prior year and/or the first day of the next year. As an example Start date: 31/12/15 (or 2015-12-31) and End date: 01/01/17 (or 2017-01-01) will download data for 2016. MERRA-2 data is based upon UTC while SAM files are local time. In the case of the SWIS, UTC+8, the first 8 hours of the year will be in the last day of the previous year; for UTC-n, the last n hours of the year will be in the first day of the next year</li>
<li>Click on the target folder field to specify a location for the MERRA-2 data. It's OK to store both wind and solar files in the same folder</li>
<li>Click <em>Get Solar</em> for solar files and <em>Get Wind</em> for wind files. If you're creating solar weather files you'll need both. When you click the buttons <code>getmerra2</code> will launch separate tasks to download the files into the target folder. You can Quit out of <code>getmerra2</code> as this stage. The two tasks will probably take a while to run as they have to download individual files for each day in the range. The output and success will be in a log file in the target folder</li>
<li>If you click <em>Check Solar</em> or <em>Check Wind</em> <code>getmerra2</code> will interrogate MERRA-2 solar files in the appropriate Target Folder to provide the boundaries for the Area of Interest and set the starting date to download the next day in sequence. The interrogation will cater for files in yearly sub-folders</li>
</ol></p></li>
<li>Once the MERRA-2 files are downloaded run <code>makeweatherfiles</code> to create the SAM weather files</p>
</li></ol>
<li><code>makeweatherfiles</code> - create weather files</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the year, 2016 in the case above</li>
<li>Click on the source folder(s) to locate the ERA5 or MERRA-2 files. This will be the same as points 3.1 above</li>
<li>Click on Target folder to specify a location for the weather files. It's convenient to use a different folder to the MERRA-2 files</li>
<li>You can click <em>File Info</em> to test if the data files are OK. This reads the first file of the year (e.g. 20160101) and displays the dimensions of the data file. The output shows the latitude and longitude cells covered</li>
<li>Click <em>Produce Solar Files</em> to create solar weather files. Clicking the button will cause <code>makeweatherfiles</code> to create the solar weather files. It will take a while to run so please be patient. There are two progress bars that will display to indicate how far along the process the program is. It will eventually return with an output listing of the files produced</li>
<li>Click <em>Produce Wind Files</em> to create the wind weather files. Same deal as solar</li>
</ol></p></li></ol>

<h4>SAM Weather Files</h4>
<h5 id="merra6">Wind Files</h5>
<p>SRW format wind files are one of the formats acceptable to SAM. This format has been chosen as it's easier to generate than other formats. MERRA-2 variables from tavg1_2d_slv_Nx data files are used to create the SRW variables.</p>

<h4 id="era7">Background on ERA5</h4>
<p>&ldquo;ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. Data is available from 1940 onwards. ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
<br />Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. ... Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I interpret each grid is centred on the latitude / longitude for that set of variables, that is, the value extends outwards in all directions from that point. The actual data is point values at the ERA5 grid point (refer <a href="https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference" target="_blank">Visualisation of regular lat/lon data</a>) so the grids are equally spaced around a data point</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="merra7">Background on MERRA-2</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) is a NASA atmospheric data reanalysis for the satellite era using a major new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System Version 5 (GEOS-5). MERRA-2 focuses on historical analyses of the hydrological cycle on a broad range of weather and climate time scales, and places the NASA EOS suite of observations in a climate context.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Each time-averaged collection consists of a continuous sequence of data averaged over the indicated interval and time stamped with the central time of the interval. For hourly data, for example, these times are 00:30 GMT, 01:30 GMT, 02:30 GMT, etc..</li>

<h3 id="index">Using other Weather Files</h3>
<p>The use of ERA5 or MERRA-2 data for the weather files is not necessary but provides a way of obtaining (gridded) weather data for any geographic area. Any weather files suitable for SAM can be used by SIREN. <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/weather" target="_blank">Weather Data</a> describes these file formats and <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/content/weather-data-non-us-locations" target="_blank">Weather Data for non-U.S. Locations</a> gives some details on where non-U.S. weather data may be obtained.</p>
<p>SIREN has two approaches for obtaining weather files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having the geographic location of the file as part of the filename. This option uses filename formats of &lt;location_latitude_longitude_year&gt; and includes files created from MERRA-2 data by <code>makeweatherfiles</code>. The location for weather files for solar and wind are defined by the <em>solar_files</em> and <em>wind_files</em> properties in the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
<li>By using an index file. To use other files you need to create index files that contain the latitude, longitude and filename for each weather file, where the filename is relative to the location for the weather files. Index files for solar and wind are defined by the <em>solar_index</em> and <em>wind_index</em> properties. You can either create these files manually or use <em>indexweather</em> to create an index</li>
</ol>
<h5>indexweather</h5>
<p><code>indexweather</code> is a program that can be used to create an index of solar and/or wind weather files for input to SAM. The program generates an index file that contains latitude, longitude and filename for each weather file. It does this by interrogating some of weather file formats supported by SAM - SAM CSV, SMW and SRW - to obtain the three variables. You can invoke the program either by choosing <code>indexweather</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>indexweather.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to simplify passing parameters to the tool. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Solar files</em>. Location of solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Solar index</em>. Name and location for solar index file</li>
<li><em>Wind files</em>. Location of wind weather files</li>
<li><em>Wind index</em>. Name and location for wind index file</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Solar Index</em> will produce a solar index file</li>
<li><em>Produce Wind Index</em> will produce a wind index file</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      indexweather.exe &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>solar=</em> Location of the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>wind=</em> Location of the wind weather files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> name of the index file to produce</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="resource">Visualising Renewable Resource Attributes</h3>
<p>To assist with placement of renewable energy stations SIREN can display a grid of renewable resource attributes derived from the SAM format weather files. This feature utilises summary data stored in a file rather than having to process hourly data from the weather files. The weather data values available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DHI (Diffuse)</em>. Average daily DHI insolation (W)</li>
<li><em>DNI (Normal)</em>. Average daily DNI insolation (W). Important for CST and Solar Thermal generation</li>
<li><em>GHI (Direct)</em>. Average daily GHI insolation (W). Important for PV generation</li>
<li><em>Temperature</em>. Average hourly temperature (<sup>o</sup>C)</li>
<li><em>Wind Speed</em>. Average hourly wind speed at 10m height (m/s)</li>
<li><em>Wind @ 50m</em>. Average hourly wind speed at 50m height (m/s). Important for Wind generation</li>
</ul>
<p>The Resource Grid window allows you to choose the period and weather variable to display and how it will appear on the SIREN map. By default the period can be either the full year, a month or a season. If there are appropriate files you can also display the variable for an hour within a month or a day. The window also has a <em>Next</em> button which allows you to &ldquo;step&rdquo; through the weather periods. You can also use <em>Page Down</em> and <em>Page Up</em> to step forward and back through the weather periods.</p>
<p>The resource files, created by <code>makegrid</code>, summarise weather data for each grid cell to avoid having to process each weather file to obtain the data for the desired time period or hour. There are three possible levels of detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily By Month (default). These files summarise the average daily figures for a year, month or season. It provides a gross view to see variances at the monthly level. This is a single spreadsheet with a very approximate disk requirement of about 11Kb per cell</li>
<li>Hourly By Month. These files summarise the average hourly figures for each month. It provides hourly variances at the monthly level. This is a spreadsheet for each month with a very approximate disk requirement of about 190Kb per cell (15Kb per month)</li>
<li>Hourly By Day. These files have hourly figures for each day. It provides hourly variances at the daily level. This is a spreadsheet for each day with a very approximate disk requirement of about 5.8Mb per cell (15Kb per day). It allows you to visualise the actual movement of weather events (sun, wind fronts) at the expense of significantly larger disk storage requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>makegrid</h4>
<p><code>makegrid</code> is a program that can be used to create the resource grid file used by SIREN. You can invoke the program either by choosing <code>makegrid</code> from the SIREN Tools menu or in Windows by running <code>makegrid.exe</code> in the <em>siren</em> folder. Running it with no parameters will present an interactive window to allow you to define what file to create. The window fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Year</em>. Year of interest</li>
<li><em>Update year</em>. If this is checked changes to the year selected will be propagated to the two Folder and Resource File fields</li>
<li><em>Level of Detail</em>. Specify the resource files to be created. Values are:- Daily By Month, Hourly By Month, or Hourly By Day</li>
<li><em>Non-zero minimum</em>. If this is checked the minimum value for all variables other than temperature will be the lowest non-zero value. For example, if this is checked solar variables will show as empty for hours outside of daylight</li>
<li><em>Solar Folder</em>. Source folder for the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>Wind Folder</em>. Source folder for the wind weather files</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>Rain Folder</em>. Source folder for the rain weather files (experimental)</li>
</div>
<li><em>Resource File</em>. Target file. This can be either a CSV or Excel (XLS) file. For an Excel file if you append <em>$MM$</em> to the year in the filename hourly variable values will be produced</li>
<li><em>Properties</em>. This is a read only field that is filled in when the file is created. This property should be copied into the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quit</em> will exit the program</li>
<li><em>Produce Resource File</em> will produce the file</li>
<li><em>Help</em> Display this help</li>
</ul>
<p>After producing the file you may want to copy contents of the <em>Properties</em> field into the <a href="#p_files">[Files]</a> Section of the Preferences file.</p>
<p>You can also run the program on the command line. In this case the parameters are passed to the program as follows:</p>
<pre>
      makegrid.exe &lt;parm1=value parm2=value&gt;
</pre>
<p>Parameters are as described above and can be passed to the program as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>year=</em> Year of interest</li>
<div class="experiment">
<li><em>rain=</em> Location of the rain weather files (experimental)</li>
</div>
<li><em>nonzero=</em> Passing a parameter of T(rue) will create non-zero minimums; otherwise the minimum value may be zero</li>
<li><em>solar=</em> Location of the solar weather files</li>
<li><em>wind=</em> Location of the wind weather files</li>
<li><em>target=</em> or <em>tgtfil=</em> Resource grid file to be produced</li>
</ul>
<p>If the source folder(s) contains other CSV files <code>makegrid</code> may fail. If this happens it is probably safer to copy the weather files to a separate folder.

<h3 id="sam">SAM Models used by SIREN</h3>
<p>SIREN uses the NREL SAM SDK API (or SSC) for energy calculations. The current SSC version is 206 (Feb 9 2019). This is a collection of tools developed by NREL for creating renewable energy system models. See <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/sdk" target="_blank">SAM Simulation Core SDK</a> for details on the SDK. NREL also provide a user-friendly front end, <a href="https://sam.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">SAM</a>, to facilitate usage of the SAM models. The SAM front end will allow you to progress any modelling by SIREN to a greater level of detail.</p>
<p>The SAM models are very comprehensive and can be quite complex. For example, there are around 200 input variables possible for the Solar Thermal model SIREN uses. To simplify the interface to SAM, SIREN uses a variable file for each technology to store default values for most variables and only requires a minimal number of variables to be set by the user, such as Capacity. The models used by SIREN and their variable files are as follows:</p>

<p>These files are Excel files. It is possible to update the variables by changing the value in the <em>DEFAULT</em> column. If the value is <em>Input</em> that variable is (already) set by SIREN. If you choose to use the changes to SIREN to support larger turbines (rotor diameter > 85) you can set the default value for <em>wind_turbine_hub_ht</em> in the <em>windpower</em> variables file to <em>Input</em>.</p>
<h4>Using the full power of SAM</h4>
<p>It is possible to use the full capabilities of SAM by one of two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use SAM:
<ol>
<li>Run the appropriate model and parameters for the station of interest</li>
<li>Save the hourly power generation figures produce by SAM</li>
<li>Update the Power File field for the station to point this file</li>
<li>Rather than running the Power Model SIREN will access this data file to obtain the hourly figures</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a specific variables file for the technology you're interested in</li>
<ol>
<li>Using the existing file as a starting point create you own version of the file. The structure of the file is generally self-explanatory. Most of the file is created from the SDK with an addition <em>DEFAULT</em> column </li>
<li>Update the appropriate property in the <a href="#p_sam_modules">[SAM Modules]</a> Section of the Preferences file to point to your file</li>
<li>SIREN will then use your file to process that technology</li>
<li>If you require different options for different stations with the same technology you can use the <em>Save Hourly Data Output</em> option to save the output for each station. Using <em>Generation - from chosen stations</em> you can create a more specific file</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#help">Back to top</a></p>
<div class="experiment">
<h3 id="nonsam">Other Models used by SIREN (experimental)</h3>
<p>SIREN will support models to accommodate other technologies not supported by SAM models. As well as this it is possible to provide a list of generation figures for a Station using the <em>Power File</em> field (see <a href="#stations">Stations</a>).
<h4>BESS (Battery)</h4>
<p>This is currently a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; for battery energy storage systems</p>
<h4>Hydro</h4>
<p>The Hydro model used in SIREN is a very simplistic model computed by multiplying station capacity by the defined capacity factor for Hydro.</p>
<h4>Wave</h4>
<p>The Wave model used in SIREN is (currently) a very simplistic model computed using wind speed (after Bretschneider and Sverdrup and Munk):
<p><pre>
     Wave_Height = 0.023 * 0.3048 * (Wind_Speed * 1.94384)<sup>2</sup></code>&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.3048 converts feet to metres, 1.94384 converts knots to m/s)
     Wave_Period = 0.45 * Wind_Speed * 1.94384
     Wave_Power = Wave_Height<sup>2</sup> * Wave_Period * Efficiency of technology
</pre>
<p>There is no constraint (such as being in water) on where Stations may be placed. The CFs are probably too high but can be reduced by capping wave height (<em>[Wave] cutout</em>) to, say, around 2.?m</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>SIREN will also support creation of you own model to support other technologies. The approach is to execute a model formula that you create for each of the 8,760 hours of appropriate weather data to calculate the power produced for that hour. The formula can be created by referencing each of the weather data variables, any other variables you define for that technology plus normal mathematical operators (refer to <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math#Mathematical_Operators" target="_blank">en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math#Mathematical_Operators</a>). The weather variables recognised are: <em>dhi</em>, <em>dni</em>, <em>ghi</em>, <em>temp</em>, <em>wind</em>, and <em>wind50</em>. To achieve this you need to:
<ol>
<li>Identify the technology by giving it a name of <em>Other</em> plus a suffix, say <em>Other Tech</em>, and create a Section with that name in the Preferences file</li>
<li>Create appropriate Properties for that technology and any other variables you want for it (see the <a href="#p_other">[Other]</a> Section in the Preferences file)</li>
<li>There are standard Properties of <em>area</em>, <em>capital_cost</em>, <em>icon</em>, and <em>o_m_cost</em>.</li>
<li>The formula is identified by the <em>formula</em> property. Any calculated value will be capped at 1 to prevent a CF greater than 1</li>

<p><code>worldwindow</code> can be used with <code>getmap</code> (see <a href="#map">Obtaining a Suitable Map Image</a>), <code>getera5</code> (see <a href="#getera5">Get ERA5 Files</a>) or <code>getmerra2</code> (see <a href="#getmerra2">Get MERRA-2 Files</a>) to choose the Area of Interest for a map or for downloading ERA5 or MERRA-2 data. It presents a world map and allows you to choose the area of interest by clicking within the map and updating the area values in the two calling programs</p>
<h4>Using worldwindow</h4>
<p>To use <code>worldwindow</code> you simply left click in the map the top left corner of the desired Area of Interest and then left click the bottom right corner. <code>worldwindow</code> will display a rectangle on the world map highlighting the desired area and update the Area of Interest in the calling program. To choose a different area just repeat the process.
